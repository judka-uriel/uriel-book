| In the beginning, when G‑d was creating heaven and earth, and the earth was in disorder and void | בְּרֵאשִׁ֖ית בָּרָ֣א אֱלֹהִ֑ים אֵ֥ת הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם וְאֵ֥ת הָאָֽרֶץ וְהָאָ֗רֶץ הָיְתָ֥ה תֹ֙הוּ֙ וָבֹ֔הוּ |
|| (Beresheet [1:1-2](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.1-2)) |
{: .chapter .capitalize #tohu-vavohu title="Chaos and Void" }

In the beginning, the Torah teaches how our Universe, which G‑d created, is arranged.
In the phrase *[tohu va‑vohu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tohu_wa-bohu)*
these two words have two different meanings:

1. disorder, chaos
2. void, emptiness

These meanings correspond to two possible initial states of program memory.
And indeed,
[uninitialized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninitialized_variable)
memory appears as disorder and chaos — memory cells do not contain specific
assigned values.  Instead, they contain random values.
Such chaotic unpredictable values can often cause program failure.
Therefore, before first use, memory must be
[initialized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_(programming)).

After initialization, memory becomes empty —
in the sense that the cells are filled with uniform initial values,
such as zero values in computer memory.

Here is an illustrative example of different initial states of memory
with *tohu va‑vohu*.  First, uninitialized memory filled with
random values can be imagined as chaotically flickering
[white noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise)
on a screen in the absence of signal: <!-- so-called “snow” -->
<!-- Snow is mentioned in Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer
[3:8](https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.3.8)
and in Sefer HaZohar Beresheet
[4:17](https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar,_Bereshit.4.17). -->

![white noise image](../../../files/book/white_noise.jpg){:.center}

| and darkness over the surface of the abyss | וְחֹ֖שֶׁךְ עַל־פְּנֵ֣י תְה֑וֹם |
|| (Beresheet [1:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.2)) |
{: .chapter .page-break}

And when the entire array of cells is set to its initial state, this
appears as a black screen — when the computer is already turned on,
but the operating system has not yet loaded:

![black square image](../../../files/book/black_square.jpg){:.center}

<!-- For example, in RGB the value of the black color is (0, 0, 0). -->

Whereas a computer contains memory with cells having different states,
the display of memory contents can be represented as pixels on
a two-dimensional computer screen.  The most graphic representation is
a liquid-crystal display matrix, where each cell is updated simultaneously
with the others.

In the very same way it occurs throughout the entire world,
only at the foundation of the Universe lies not a two-dimensional,
but a three-dimensional array of states.  Just as we gaze from the
three-dimensional dimension upon a two-dimensional computer screen, which
projects the state of memory, so does G‑d gaze upon our three-dimensional
world, which displays the state of the Universe.

Therefore G‑d is simultaneously both beyond the world and within it, that is,
on one hand G‑d looks upon the entire Universe from the outside, while
on the other hand at the most fundamental level beneath the known elementary
particles G‑d has access to every element of the memory array.  As it is said:

> G‑d in heaven above and on earth below
(Devarim [4:39](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.4.39),
Yehoshua [2:11](https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.2.11))

On the macrocosmic level the entire Universe is contained within a bounded
space, while outside there exists a computer on which the program runs,
i.e., the *software*.  On the other hand, on the subquantum level each
smallest physical particle is connected to memory elements, therefore the
earth corresponds to the concept of *hardware*.

Why is it said that at the time when heaven and earth were being created,
the earth was in disorder and void?  Because this corresponds to the cells
of physical memory.  First in heaven the program is created and launched,
and then this program fills the physical memory, which is part of the hardware.

In computers the initialization of memory is preceded by the process called
[memory allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_memory_allocation),
i.e., the allocation of space for the program to run.
In Kabbalah this process is called
*[tzimtzum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzimtzum)* —
the allocation of space for subsequent Creation.

Thus Creation was performed in the following order:
memory allocation (*tzimtzum*) → primordial chaos → memory initialization → void
(uniform filling) → setting of initial state <!-- (*Atziluth*, Primordial Emanation) -->
→ launching the program of Universe's development (Big Bang).
{: #big-bang title="Big Bang" }

<!--
Disorder, chaos — a state with maximum entropy.
Void, emptiness — a state with minimum entropy.
Disorder, chaos with maximum entropy is transformed
into a state of emptiness with zero entropy, i.e.,
an absolute decrease of entropy has occurred.
And after the program is launched, entropy begins to increase.-->

The entire world is the result of the program written by G‑d.  <!-- As the
midrash Beresheet Rabbah [1:4](https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.1.4)
explains, for the creation of the world there was created the program called
the Torah and the Throne of Glory upon which it was to be executed. -->
<!-- The Zohar affirms that G‑d gazed into the Torah when He created the world. -->
<!-- Yeshayahu [66:1](https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.66.1) confirms that
the entire Universe is running upon the Throne of G‑d. -->
<!-- Also was programmed the appearance of the Patriarchs,
Israel, the Temple and the name of Mashiach. -->

| and the spirit of G‑d levitated over the waters | וְר֣וּחַ אֱלֹהִ֔ים מְרַחֶ֖פֶת עַל־פְּנֵ֥י הַמָּֽיִם |
|| (Beresheet [1:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.2)) |
{: .chapter}

The word *levitated* <!-- root word *Levite* --> <!-- *merachefet* -->
means that the spirit, as the presence of G‑d in the creation
of the world, ascended above matter, overcoming
[gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity), with the creation
of which G‑d began to implement the fundamental physical laws of
interaction of elementary particles as the foundation of the program of the
world's development, and therein defined the gravitational constant *G*.

Just as constants are defined at the beginning of a program, G‑d defined the
physical and mathematical constants that determine the parameters of the
Universe's development.  At the beginning of Creation, G‑d programmed all
physical laws (as theorems and rules) and very precisely established
the initial state and adjusted fundamental constants (as axioms and facts).
The slightest deviation from the predefined values would have made the
emergence of life on Earth, and even the Earth itself, impossible.

G‑d can easily run the program again and again, so that before creating our
Universe G‑d could have already created multitudes of similar worlds for
testing and selecting suitable values of
[physical constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_constant).

Midrash Beresheet Rabbah [3:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.3.7),
[9:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.9.2)
confirms the necessity of multiple trial runs
of previous worlds until G‑d saw that *ki‑tov*:
that our world is good, finally succeeded in becoming as it should be.  Through
[fine-tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_universe) of the Universe,
i.e., setting of precise values for fundamental physical constants, the
emergence of life became possible.  Had they differed even slightly,
life would have been impossible.

*[Sefer Yetzirah](https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Yetzirah.1.1)*
(*Book of Creation*, *Book of Abraham*) says that G‑d created the Universe
through three derivatives of one foundation (books — *sefarim*):

1. *sippur* — utterance
2. *sefer* — scripture
3. *sfar* — number

As explained by [Yehuda Halevi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_Halevi)
in the book *[Kuzari](https://www.sefaria.org/Kuzari.4.25)*: *sippur* is
speech activity that determines the purpose and properties of the entities
being created, “language in action”; *sefer* is the action representing the
process of implementing the plan; and the category *sfar* corresponds to
the numbers that establish the structure of things to be created, so that
they precisely realize the plan of Creation.  This demonstrates that
numbers lie at the foundation of the Universe, that the Universe is built
upon numbers, where numbers are the values of memory cells upon which the
Universe is based.
<!-- As the mathematician Kronecker observed: “G‑d created the
whole numbers, everything else is the work of man”, in the sense that the
Universe is founded upon numbers, while man has the ability
to perform further operations. -->

All these categories in reality describe different stages
of the process of developing and executing a program
(*[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps)*):

1. program design and development with articulation of all details —
   corresponds to the words “And G‑d said”;
2. writing the program code — corresponds to the words “And G‑d created”;
3. execution of the program, operating with internal representations in the
   form of numbers in computer memory — corresponds to the words “And it was so”.
{: style="page-break-inside: avoid"}

In Kabbalah these stages correspond to the
[spiritual worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Worlds):

<!-- 0\. Atziluth — the world of Emanation; -->

1. Beriah — the world of Creation, designing the program;
2. Yetzirah — the world of Formation, writing the program;
3. Asiyah — the world of Action, launching the program.

In the beginning, G‑d programmed the physical laws of this world, which
operate upon a three-dimensional array whose elements have states that
change according to the given program.  After launching the program of the
creation of the Universe 13.8 billion years ago, <!-- ≈10<sup>10</sup> -->
all further development proceeded automatically, according to the
programmed algorithms: the emergence of galaxies, the Solar System,
the Earth, the genesis and evolution of life on Earth.

Previously there were doubts concerning the impossibility of such a sequence,
whereby first were created the seed-bearing plants and trees of every kind
bearing fruit, and only thereafter the luminaries, and so forth.
However at present, having modern knowledge of programming, we can
finally understand that in the process of programming it doesn't matter
in what order the various subroutines are created.  One can first implement
the function for transmitting genetic information by means of DNA
molecules, and only thereafter can program the function for the evolution
of stars and planetary systems.  Therefore in the first chapter is recorded
not the order of the program's execution (when according to the laws
of evolution the earth brings forth grass, trees, and so forth),
but rather the order of the stages of programming the Universe.

<!-- In the commentary of Tosafot on
Rosh HaShanah [27a](https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.27a.15?with=Tosafot),
to reconcile the two opinions whether the world was created
in Tishrei or in Nisan, Rabbenu Tam said that the creation of the world
was conceived in the month of Tishrei, yet in reality the world was created
in the month of Nisan.  So it is possible that the world was programmed in Tishrei,
while the program was launched in Nisan.
And in Rosh HaShanah [11a](https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.11a.2)
it is said that in Nisan not only was the world created and forefathers were
redeemed from Egypt, but the final Redemption shall also come to pass in Nisan. -->

The so-called [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang) is
the initial stage of the program's operation after startup.  After the
allocation and initialization of memory, the initial values of cell states
were established, i.e., the initial state of the program.  Thereafter
the program began its work, and gradually space began to fill with matter,
as memory fills with bits, which differ mathematically in numerical values,
and physically in different voltage levels.

Filling memory with initial values and subsequent launch appeared as
emanation of the ray *Ohr Ein Sof* — the Infinite Divine Light
into the center of empty space.
In [Lurianic Kabbalah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lurianic_Kabbalah)
this ray is called *kav* (line) — through it the light descended
into the space and became the source of all subsequent Creation.
{: #light title="Light"}

<!-- Divine light — *URIEL*, [אוריאל](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/אוריאל). -->

| And G‑d said: Let there be light, and there was light. | וַיֹּ֥אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֖ים יְהִ֣י א֑וֹר וַֽיְהִי־אֽוֹר |
|| (Beresheet [1:3](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.3)) |
{: .chapter}

The essence of this Torah passage is most accurately conveyed
by the famous painting of the renowned Israeli artist:

<figure>
  <img src="../../../files/book/ohr.jpg" alt="[ohr light]">
  <figcaption>LIGHT, S.LENKER, Composition no III, oil</figcaption>
  <!-- <figcaption>

  </figcaption> -->
</figure>

The Kabbalistic book *[Zohar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zohar)*
reveals that the point of the word *light*, that is,
the capacity received through this light for humans to perceive
and depict this concept — this itself is light (Sefer HaZohar,
Beresheet [5:34](https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar,_Bereshit.5.34)).
The image visually illustrates this thought.
<!-- The point is an infinitely small magnitude
on the infinite straight ray of light *kav*. -->

From a philosophical standpoint, the picture demonstrates
the unity of form and content.

And in linguistic terms, words that have the properties
described by the meanings of the words themselves are called
*[autological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autological_word)*.
For example, the word *mul-ti-syl-lab-ic* indeed has multiple syllables.
When the form of a word corresponds to its content, when a word depicts the
concept denoted by that very word, and is essentially an autological image,
then it is called by the term *autologlyph*.  In this case, in the painting,
the word אור, depicting light itself, is an autologlyph.

If we attempt to delve deeper into the meaning, it becomes clear that the
painting captures the purpose of the created Universe and the goal of human
existence.

In the emanating light G‑d placed the meaning of existence of this world,
and of each person in particular — the reception of Divine light and the
filling with Divine light of all
[Sefirot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefirot): filling with knowledge,
understanding, wisdom, severity, mercy, balance, and so on.

Thus, G‑d gave meaning to Creation, and one of the purposes is coming closer
to the Creator, which includes the necessity to study Creation and improve it,
receiving the Divine light that fills the entire created world,
setting the direction of development and nourishing all that lives.

<!-- With a certain imagination, one can discern that at the corners of the
triangle are positioned [Pac-Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man)
with open mouths — they symbolize living beings that feed upon the Divine
light and yearn toward it.  -->

<!-- Throughout the time of writing this book, the picture stood before my
eyes and constantly reminded me of the purpose for which this world was
created.  And I endeavored that this book might help make the world better. -->

| And G‑d said: Let there be luminaries in the firmament of heaven | וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים יְהִ֤י מְאֹרֹת֙ בִּרְקִ֣יעַ הַשָּׁמַ֔יִם לְהַבְדִּ֕יל |
|| (Beresheet [1:14](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.14)) |
{: .chapter}

Different levels of interpretation help to understand all the embedded meanings.

At the hidden level of understanding רז, which has the same gematria as אור,
[light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohr) — the Divine emanation for
filling spiritual vessels.

The next level of understanding רמז (*remez*) has the gematria
that coincides with the word מאור (luminous body), meaning
a [luminous body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight)
that nourishes life on Earth with its light.

And at the most simple level of *peshat*, corresponding to the direct
meaning, i.e., at the fundamental physical level,
[light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light) is electromagnetic radiation
perceived by the human eye.  At this level, light represents a flow of
photons, for which there is established
a [speed limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_limit)
for the movement of light at ≈1 billion kilometers per hour.

From this it is evident that light is present at all levels:

1. the soul receives G‑d's emanation for its development;
2. the body is nourished by solar energy for the sustenance of life;
3. the mind through the eyes receives information and knowledge, transmitted by means of photons.

<!-- These levels correspond to the central sefirot:
1. Keter, Tiferet; 2. Yesod, Malkhut; 3. Da'at. -->

<!--
| and the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their array | וַיְכֻלּ֛וּ הַשָּׁמַ֥יִם וְהָאָ֖רֶץ וְכָל־צְבָאָֽם |
|| (Beresheet [2:1](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.1)) |
{: .chapter}

The word *tzva'am* translates as *array*,
which in programming corresponds to the concept of
[array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_(data_structure)).
-->

Photons as quanta of light are defined as among the
[fundamental elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle),
which at the current stage of scientific development cannot be decomposed into constituent parts.
{: #physics title="Digital Physics"}

At the same time, there exist scientific hypotheses that space can be quantized
even further.  In particular, this may make possible the construction of
a theory of [quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity),
unifying quantum mechanics and Einstein's general theory of relativity.

One of the first proposed models of subcomponents of elementary particles were the
[Harari rishons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishon_model).
This model introduces two new fundamental particles, called
*rishons* (first).  One of the particles is called *T* from the word
*Tohu* (disorder), and the other particle is called *V* from the word
*Vohu* (void).  All leptons and quarks may be composed of these particles.

In the course of further theoretical development,
[loop quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity)
was proposed, based upon the discreteness of space, wherein space consists of
quantum cells whose granular size is several orders of magnitude smaller
than 10<sup>−35</sup> m.
To describe the states and interactions between particles in this theory,
[spin networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_network) were employed,
which are graphs whose vertices determine the state of particles, while the
edges define the geometry of fields.  To represent the quantum state of the
entire Universe requires a spin network containing ≈10<sup>184</sup> nodes.
Time is also discrete, and the spin network is updated with
a [clock frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_signal)
of ≈10<sup>−43</sup> seconds.
As Lee Smolin maintains, this theory may be verified experimentally when
contemporary apparatus shall be so perfected as to permit the requisite
experiments (at present the resolving power is limited to ≈10<sup>−22</sup> m).

This idea has received further development recently in the theory of
[Wolfram physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Physics_Project),
which attempts to base the laws of physics on the transformation of hypergraphs
through rewriting rules.  In this theory the entire Universe consists
of discrete points connected by abstract relations.  But different scales
make it possible to perceive the entire array as continuous space,
just as a stream of water is perceived not as a flow of H<sub>2</sub>O molecules.
With a minimal point size ≈10<sup>−93</sup> m and an electron radius
≈10<sup>−81</sup> m, an electron could contain ≈10<sup>35</sup> hypergraph
elements.  According to preliminary estimates, to reach the current state
of the Universe, ≈10<sup>500</sup> transformation steps would be required
on ≈10<sup>400</sup> points of the spatial hypergraph.

This theory was preceded by the publication of a book with the unpretentious title
*[A New Kind of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Kind_of_Science)* —
only in reality it is neither new nor science, but otherwise everything is correct.

- Not new, since the ideas of the computable Universe were developed by other
scientists long before the book was written, including similar theories:
[causal sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_sets),
[causal dynamical triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_dynamical_triangulation),
etc.

The book attempts to illustrate the principle of the transition of quantity
into quality, but the enormous quantity of pictures and words in the book
did not transition into quality — the book revealed nothing new.
<!-- The same can be said of the voluminous tome of the Zohar, where
quantity does not transform into quality that would reveal absolute truths,
and instead of seeking truth, too much attention is devoted to justifying
accumulated stringencies.  Therefore it is not surprising that some rabbis
criticized the Zohar.  The Zohar is not Torah.  Therefore part of the Zohar
is true, part is not.  That is, even within Kabbalah itself there are its
sparks of holiness and qlippoth.  For example, sparks of holiness — the
system of Sefirot, etc. -->
It has long been known that simple rules can produce systems
far more complex than their initial states.  The concept of
[algorithmic undecidability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem)
is likewise not new, yet in place of this the book coins a new term
*computational irreducibility* — the impossibility of predicting the state
of a system at a given moment in time when the initial conditions and the
system's development up to that moment are unknown.  Based upon this,
a supposition is put forth that free will does not exist — it is asserted
that all human actions are determined, only there exists no possibility of
predicting subsequent actions.

- Not a science: for the same reasons why Kabbalah cannot be called a science
until certain conditions are fulfilled.

The principal criterion of scientific validity of a theory,
formulated by Karl Popper, is its
[falsifiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability).
A theory is scientific if there exists a possibility of its experimental
refutation.  For Kabbalah to be considered a science, one would need to
devise such experiments whereby one could obtain results that would
confirm or refute the theory.

In general, the original title *chokhmat ha‑kabbalah* can be translated in
various ways: “science of receiving”, “wisdom of receiving”, “teaching of
receiving”, etc.  Therefore, the use of the term “science” may be
explained by peculiarities of translation — after all, in Hebrew it
corresponds not to *mada*, but to *chokhmah*.

The same problem exists with regard to the aforementioned book — the word
“science” in the title is justified only when there exists the possibility
to verify assertions through experimental means.  On the other hand, the
main portion of the book's material may be classified as pertaining to the
concept of [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science),
as a subdivision of mathematics that investigates the application of data
structures and algorithms, in this case for describing the evolution of the
Universe.  In this sense all the proposed data models and algorithms
are scientifically reliable and may be confirmed empirically
through computer calculations, i.e.,
[verifiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation).
Only the connection of this computer theory with actual physical laws has
not yet been confirmed.  And until then one must avoid the use of the term
“science”.

Thus did Edward Fredkin, who first called the theory
*[digital physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_physics)*,
and later, when he realized that this theory had little in common with
science, and that it remained unknown what physical experiments might
confirm it, honestly transitioned to using the new term
*[digital philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_philosophy)*.

This theory presupposes that there exists a program which runs upon
a gigantic universal computer and computes the evolution of the Universe.
<!-- By the way, it would be incorrect to use the term “information” here,
because representing physical phenomena on the basis of information
transmission would only make sense when there exists a mind that can
receive this information. -->  <!-- And such a theory can indeed explain
quantum entanglement, e.g., as memory cells linked to one another
or two pointers to a single memory cell. -->

One of the possible implementations of such a program could be
[cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton).
The most illustrative example of a cellular automaton is the
[Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life),
in which cells on the playing grid are updated according to elementary rules.
The diversity of results depends upon the initial state of the cells.
By placing different patterns on the field, we can observe their development.
A great number of interesting initial patterns have been discovered,
which have been given names characterizing their behavior.  For example, there is
[Methuselah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methuselah_(cellular_automaton))
with its long-lived configuration and
[Gan Eden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden_(cellular_automaton))
with configurations that are impossible to reach, etc.
One of the simplest moving patterns is the
[glider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(Conway's_Game_of_Life)).
According to this same principle, photons may move through space.
Then just as the speed of the glider's movement is limited by the
processor's clock frequency, the speed of a photon's movement
in vacuum may be limited by the clock frequency of cell updates
on the Universe's grid.

The precise number of processors calculating each subsequent state of the
Universe cannot be known to us.  This number falls within the interval from
one global processor, which sequentially traverses all cells, to one
processor for each cell, updating their state in parallel simultaneously
with all other processors.

The first variant with one global processor then resembles the operation of a
[mobile automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_automaton)
with one active cell or in a more general sense a
[Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine)
with an active head.  In modern processors this corresponds to the
*[program counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_counter)*
or *instruction pointer*.  In this case the states are updated not by the
cells themselves according to their separate program, but the state of each
cell is updated as a result of the global program's operation, as occurs
when the simple operational rules of such a cellular automaton as
in the Game of Life are emulated on a single-processor computer with
[von Neumann architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture).

The second variant with simultaneous updating resembles the operation of
parallel cellular automata, where each cell is an autonomous computational
unit with its own processor, much as it is designed in
[quantum dot cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot_cellular_automaton).

But neither of these extreme variants is optimal,
therefore the truth lies somewhere in the middle.

The rules for updating each cell may depend upon varying amounts of
context, i.e., different quantities of data supplied as input to the
algorithm for computing the next state of the cell.  In contrast to
cellular automata operating according to the simplest rules, where the
state of a cell depends upon the previous state only of neighboring cells,
the algorithms for updating each cell of the Universe may depend not only
upon neighboring cells, but may also perform
[pattern matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching)
upon a vast multitude of cells, in the extreme upon all cells.  Thereby the
complexity of the rules increases manifold, and the program for updating
cells must operate according to algorithms with a high level of
computational complexity.

The ideal variant would be the unification of the cells of the Universe
into an enormous multilayered
[neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)).
Then each “neuron” of such a network could be connected with a multitude of
others, not necessarily neighboring ones.  Moreover, as necessity arises,
the connections between neurons could be updated dynamically.  Such
optimization would guarantee the existence of only relevant dependencies.

But in any case, the already existing structure of the Universe is designed
and implemented well (*ki‑tov*).  And despite the fact that such a great
project was completed in a short time (the programming process
took only six days), it is evident that all details were carefully
thought through.  So both in terms of execution deadlines and quality,
there are no complaints.  And since everything works well, it is better
not to change anything.

<!--
The commandment to walk in the ways of G‑d and to emulate Him
in all things is closely connected with the theme of
[postmodernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism).
{: #postmodern title="Postmodernism"}

Postmodernism is the capacity to place oneself in the position of G‑d
and observe the world from the outside.  Just as G‑d looks upon our world from
without, so too must we strive periodically to gaze upon the world from the
exterior.  As spirituality manifests when one endeavors to see the world through
the eyes of one's neighbor in order to better understand their worldview, so too
does an outside perspective on our world help one to better comprehend it.

The opposite of postmodernism is directness, immediacy, i.e., immediate
participation in real life.  This opposition of “practice vs theory”
is evident in the example of the dichotomy of parts of tradition:

- halakhic: when one directly practices the observance of traditions;
- aggadic: when one studies from the outside, e.g. the study of religion
  and its history is also one of the manifestations of postmodernism.

We cannot say that only one part should be retained while the other must
be avoided.  Living as an active player in real life, people can be both
compassionate and cruel — whereas in the past people were primarily cruel.
And viewing life from the sidelines as a detached observer, one can be both
compassionate and cruel, when irony reaches the point of cold cynicism.
Just as any instrument can be used in different ways, so too can postmodernism
be applied with varying results.

Just as G‑d looks from the outside upon the history of humanity, so too does
postmodernism allow people to absorb the lessons of history and learn from
the mistakes of the past.  As it is said, “history repeats itself twice: first
as tragedy, then as farce”.  History repeats itself as farce when people do not
learn from past mistakes and step on the same rake again and again.  And then it
becomes a tragicomedy.  Tragicomedies are closely connected with postmodernism
as the ability to view one's problems with detachment and impartiality and the
readiness to laugh at them.  And through laughter and irony it becomes easier
to cope with the “unbearable lightness of being”.

When the Haredim withdraw from life and
[seclude themselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapism)
in their ghetto, when even in Israel they live as in galut, which corresponds to
[inner emigration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_emigration),
they lack the possibility of rising above the world, as postmodernism
presupposes.  And when they attempt to apply historically obsolete
customs in the present time, this is not postmodernism, but simply
[historical reenactment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_reenactment)
and [cosplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosplay).

Therefore it is desirable to maintain a balance between immediacy and
postmodernism.  The level of postmodernism needs to be self-regulated,
so that it remains moderate and does not reach cynicism and denial of
moral values.  Through responsible actions in relationships between people,
the emotional and physical sefirot are primarily filled — just as tragicomedies
realize *tiferet*, which organically unites the *gevurah* of tragedies and the
*chesed* of comedies.  And for filling the intellectual sefirot, we can apply
postmodernism, which helps to rise above different situations in order to look
from the outside — and then with the filling of the sefirah *Binah* comes
understanding of problems and situations, and with the filling of the
sefirah *Chokhmah* comes the solution to problems.

In recent times, people weary of postmodernist irony strive to return
to the beautiful era of simple-hearted human relationships through
*[new sincerity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_sincerity)*.
All of this occurs within the framework of a new concept called
*[metamodernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamodernism)*, which represents
an oscillation like the swinging of a pendulum between the earnest sincerity of
modernism and the mocking irony of postmodernism, and even their synthesis
into ironic sincerity.  This is what I have attempted to maintain throughout
this book.

In this book I have not invented anything new, but have only
endeavored to focus attention upon known facts, connecting them together
through associative links and meaningful analogies.  Moreover, I utterly
lack the imagination for devising new theories.  Already thousands of years
ago it was said in Kohelet [1:9](https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.1.9)
that there is nothing new under the sun.
Therefore, all that is said in the book is based on Torah and science
(*[Torah u‑mada](https://en.wikipedia.org/Torah_Umadda)*).
{: #torah-umadda title="Torah and Science"}

The history of resolving contradictions between religion and science spans
several centuries.  On this subject spoke such great Jewish rationalist
philosophers as [Saadia Gaon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Gaon),
who sought to reconcile faith with philosophical teachings, and
[Maimonides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides), who rejected
traditional superstitions and astrology, insisted upon the priority of
reason and empirical experience, and advocated
[allegorical interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegorical_interpretations_of_Genesis#Rabbinic_teachings)
of the Torah compatible with scientific facts.

For the contemporary believer, there should remain no doubt regarding
the priority of scientific objectivity over the outmoded conceptions of
antiquity.  Science allows us to investigate the world created by G‑d in
all its manifestations.  The pursuit of science as an important instrument
for understanding the surrounding world is even prescribed by the
commandments of the Torah, including “and fill the earth, and master it”
(Beresheet [1:28](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.28)).  The
establishment of dominion over nature encompasses scientific and
technological progress.  But it must be noted that progress should not
become an end in itself, but only a means of achieving more elevated goals,
such as the improvement of quality of life and the creation of conditions
for spiritual development.

If some theory is not confirmed by experimental scientific methods, then
the authors of such theories ought to honestly acknowledge that their
theory is a matter of faith, and not declare their theories to be science.
Otherwise, if they insist upon calling their theories science, their
theories should be declared pseudoscience, false science — just as a person
who makes predictions that do not come to pass is declared a false prophet.

It is impossible to continue believing in that which has been refuted by
science.  When the faculties granted to mankind by G‑d have enabled the
discovery of previously unknown truths, there remain no justifications for
continuing to uphold obsolete conceptions.  For me this is equivalent to
falsehood: as if a person already knows the truth but continues to
speak contradictory information, that is, untruth.  As one who is deeply
believing, I would be ashamed before G‑d to deny truths revealed by
science.  Conscience, that is fear of G‑d, does not permit belief in
anti-scientific theories.  No G‑d-fearing person would act in such
a manner.

For example, in our time it would be dense ignorance to continue believing
in the [geocentric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentrism)
of the world.  There is not even sense in devising compromise theories of the
[geoheliocentric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonic_system), because the
[heliocentric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism)
does not cancel and does not even diminish
[anthropocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocentrism) as
a system of values that figuratively places humans at the center of Creation.
For humanity, Earth remains the center of the Universe despite the fact
that it revolves around the Sun, and the star called Sun revolves around
the center of the Milky Way galaxy.  It is interesting to note that
the plane of rotation of the Solar System does not coincide with
the plane of rotation of the Milky Way, but is inclined at a 60° angle.

Especially unreasonable is belief in the existence of extraterrestrial
intelligence.  Faith in contact with alien civilizations, in various
conspiracy theories that extraterrestrials secretly control earthlings,
arises from lack of faith in G‑d — one who lives with G‑d has no need to
await the arrival of aliens.

Throughout all the Universe there is none besides G‑d alone
(Devarim [4:35,39](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.4.35-39)).
The Lubavitcher Rebbe maintained that the existence of
extraterrestrial intelligent life with free will is impossible,
because in such a case they would have their own Torah, but the
existence of another Torah is impossible — in accordance with one
of the thirteen principles of Judaism according to Rambam.

If it were necessary to give life to other kinds of rational beings,
then instead of trying to squeeze them all into one Universe,
(additionally applying efforts to exclude any contact between them),
it would be much simpler to create a separate world for them.
As our Universe — a sphere with a diameter of merely about 93 billion light years,
containing only 10<sup>80</sup> atoms, so when necessary for other
rational beings G‑d can easily create another such one with rational life.

But why did G‑d create the entire Universe solely for humans?
Why is there such tremendous abundance of matter in our Universe?
What justifies this irrational expenditure of material resources?
For what purpose was such enormous redundancy created?

First of all, it's beautiful.  The bottomless heavens with countless
myriads of stars overwhelm us with their beauty — Carl Sagan calculated
that in the entire Universe there are more stars than grains of sand on Earth.
And the number of cells in living organisms 10<sup>30</sup>
(the human body alone contains 100 trillion cells) exceeds the number
of grains of sand on Earth by a trillion times, and is a million times
greater than the estimated number of stars in the Universe.
It strikes the imagination by the abundance of diverse forms of life
on Earth, where the most resilient differ in size from the largest
polar bears, capable of swimming hundreds of kilometers in icy water,
to microscopic [water bears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade),
capable of surviving in extreme conditions.  Recently for an experiment
they were sent to the Moon aboard the spacecraft
*[Beresheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beresheet)*, but the first
launch was as unsuccessful as the first trial launches of the Universe.

And all this richness of forms of existence was created by G‑d.
But not in such a primitive manner as is represented
by the pseudoscientific movements
“[scientific creationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_science)” and
“[intelligent design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design)”.
Such unscientific theories ought not be taught
in educational institutions during lessons of natural scientific
disciplines — school lessons are intended for teaching sciences and those
scientific theories that can be verified in practice through observations or
experiments.

Proponents of “intelligent design” theory are incapable of imagining that
there exists a possibility for the evolution of complex systems based upon
the simplest rules.  Perhaps they are unfamiliar with computer
technologies, and in particular have never beheld such wondrous results
of programs that construct with astounding
[beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_beauty)
the most complex structures according to the simplest algorithms, such as
[fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal)-based
[Mandelbrot sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) and
[Julia sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set),

<!-- In the second iteration, shaped like a Magen David —

then grandfather David was greatly astonished. -->
Or it suffices to purchase a head of
[Romanesco broccoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanesco_broccoli),
whose fractal form grows according to its genetic code.

At present, for believers there remains only one single reasonable
possibility for reconciling religion and science —
[theistic evolutionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theistic_evolution),
fully accepted by non-Orthodox denominations in Judaism, and also partially
prevalent in Orthodox Judaism.  According to surveys, approximately 80% of
Jews in total agree with the theory of evolution — this is a very high
percentage compared to adherents of other religions.

<!-- Among the Orthodoxes, religion takes priority over science. -->
<!-- Among the non-Orthodoxes, it is the reverse: science takes precedence over religion. -->

Theistic evolutionism is not a theory in the scientific sense, but only
an interpretation by believers of established scientific theories and facts.
In accordance with this worldview, everything in the Universe from the
interactions of elementary particles to the evolution of galaxies is
subject to the laws of nature established by G‑d, while living organisms
develop in accordance with the laws of biological evolution.

| And the L‑rd G‑d formed man from the dust of the ground | וַיִּיצֶר֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֜ים אֶת־הָֽאָדָ֗ם עָפָר֙ מִן־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה |
|| (Beresheet [2:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.7)) |
{: .chapter #body title="Body"}

The human body consists of *dust of the ground*, i.e., of atoms
and molecules, which at birth gather into the cells of the body,
forming them according to DNA programs.

The program created by G‑d and implementing the laws of the Universe's
evolution is absolutely and completely determined on all levels: just as
the evolution of galaxies and stars obeys all the programmed laws, so too
the evolution of life forms on Earth proceeds according to the given laws
of biological evolution, and the functioning of the human organism likewise
obeys all the laws of nature.

Running this program anew from the beginning, i.e., from the Big Bang,
the result would be precisely the same world, evolving into a complex
system with more than 100 billion galaxies (approximately equal to the
number of all people who have ever lived), with the same stars,
down to the emergence of planet Earth.

Just as the development of the Universe is determined with the precision of
[mechanical clockwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwork_universe),
so too is the development of the human organism from parental DNA
completely determined.  Just as the Universe is an enormous computer,
executing a given program with mathematical precision, man too is
a computer, albeit of smaller dimensions, executing a program ordained by
genetic information, wherein the most complex human organism is encoded
within small quantities of DNA molecules.  Just as even a minor alteration
of one fundamental constant of the Universe would render the emergence of
life impossible, so too can the mutation of but a single gene substantially
affect the development of the entire human body.
<!-- For example, it has been established experimentally that by altering
but a single gene on the feet of birds scales are easily transformed
into feathers. -->

Based on approximately 740 megabytes of information in the human genome
<!-- roughly a quarter of the entire genome contains the specification for the brain -->
<!-- moreover, the greater part of the information is redundant -->
there grows the brain — a computational device that exceeds in complexity
its original specification by millions of times.

All physiological processes in the human body, including the workings of
the brain, which operate according to certain mechanisms described within
the framework of [neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience),
function according to the laws of nature, i.e., the human organism,
including the brain — is simply a molecular computer that precisely
executes instructions, is completely determined and strictly obeys
the laws of physics and chemistry, including the carrying out of
such complex processes as
[DNA replication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication).

Thus, all the work of the brain, based on the transmission of electrical
signals between 100 billion neurons, each of which is connected with
thousands of other neurons by means of 100 trillion synapses, may be
reduced to biological processes, biological processes — to the laws of
chemistry, and chemistry may be
[reduced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism) to the laws of
physics, founded upon the computational processes of the Universe.

Even in its details, the work of the brain resembles the work of a computer.
For example,
[garbage collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science))
runs during idle time, much like sleep,
and it frees unused memory, minimizing the number of neurons
required for storing important information, and optimizing their
weight coefficients.  Another analogy in neural networks is the prevention
of [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting),
when an excessive quantity of parameters accumulates in the neural network,
and in the brain — too much superfluous detail.

The entire human organism is a machine executing a genetic program in
accordance with biochemical algorithms, and human reaction is determined
by the activity of nerve cells, whose state is influenced both by external
stimuli through the sense organs and by internal electrochemical processes
occurring in [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron) and
[synapses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse).

All reactions of the nervous system and human brain to external stimuli are
completely predictable.  For example, when a hand touches a hot surface,
a signal travels through the nervous system to the brain, and the brain
sends back an impulse to pull the hand away.  All such reactions occur
[instinctively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instinct) and
[reflexively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex),
depending upon the stimuli.  Therefore, the brain itself
is incapable of manifesting free will.

{: .chapter #soul title="Soul"}

The picture of determinism drawn previously is objective in its own way.
But where in it is the element of subjectivity?  After all, every person
can attest to having their own subjective experience, feels like an independent
observer of the material world, perceives reality from the outside, and
possesses [self-awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness).
The latest achievements of science shed light on this question
and help us better understand it.

Many important scientific discoveries of recent times are gathered and
examined in the book by Nobel Prize laureate in physics Roger Penrose
*[The Emperor's New Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor's_New_Mind)*.
The most important assertion of the author — human consciousness is not
algorithmic and cannot be modeled on a computer in the form of
[strong AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_AI),
and the primary significance for the emergence of consciousness in the
[neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestrated_objective_reduction)
of the brain at the
[quantum level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mind)
lies in
[wave function collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse).
Opponents of this hypothesis raise such an objection,
that a warm and moist brain cannot avoid
[decoherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence).
But at present experiments continue to be conducted,
confirming that for sufficiently long periods of time in
[microtubules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtubule)
quantum wave states can be maintained.

Well known is the experiment with
[Schrödinger's cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrödinger's_cat),
which was caught and placed in a box (only in thought, no animals
were harmed).  Let us imagine that there is also placed therein
a Geiger counter with radioactive substance.  If one of the atoms decays,
then it will set in motion a hammer, which will break a flask of
hydrocyanic acid, from which the cat will be poisoned.  Or it will not
decay, and then the cat will remain alive.  Either one or the other.
But in no wise both variants simultaneously.  So then, the choice of one
of the two variants is made at the moment when, after opening the box,
[observation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)) occurs.

Therefore the Shulchan Arukh Orach Chayim
[230](https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.230.1) with
reference to Berakhot [54a](https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.54a.4) forbids
praying for a favorable outcome of an event that has already occurred.
For example, when a person returns home and hears cries in the city, he must
not request that the incident not have happened in his house — because the
collapse of the wave function has already occurred for the observers who
participated in that event.  Or it is forbidden to pray that a boy be born
when there is a possibility to perform an ultrasound scan, etc.

It seems to me that the aforementioned experiment is not the most appropriate example,
because the cat is also an observer — it observes the state of the flask with acid.
It would be better in the experiment to replace the cat with some inanimate
unconscious object, for example, with a breaking cup or vase —
less dramatic, but more plausible.

As stated in Beresheet [1:20,21,24,30](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.20-30),
all animals have a soul (*nefesh chayah*),
and Beresheet [2:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.7)
mentions the existence of a soul in the human being.
Therefore, animals also have a soul, though less developed than
that of humans (interestingly, some animals <!-- including magpies -->
are even capable of recognizing themselves in a
[mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test)).
Unlike animals, the human has a soul of a higher level.

<!-- Observing animals, we can notice in them manifestations of the soul.
I remember how it surprised me when I observed how before a crow, her
suitor traced intricate pirouettes in parabolic flight before his beloved.
The soul manifests most fully in love, and he was demonstrating
manifestations of true love.  Manifestations of the soul in corvids are found
in the Torah: “the raven went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried
up from off the earth” (Beresheet [8:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.8.7)). -->

If we draw an analogy with a computer and a computer user, then the human body
and the brain correspond to the *hardware*, while the mind is the *software*,
i.e., the programs loaded into the computer's memory.
Then the user is the soul itself, which operates this computer.
Animals have a simpler brain with a simple mind, therefore simpler souls
of the *nefesh* level are connected to them.
And in humans, a more complex brain structure allows for loading more advanced
intelligence into the brain and connecting a more complex soul.
<!-- In precisely the same way, G‑d can place prophecies only into more
intellectually advanced minds, as the Rambam observed in the *Moreh Nevukhim*
[2:32](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_Part_2.32.5). -->

> The soul of man is the lamp of G‑d
(Mishlei [20:27](https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.20.27))

Kabbalah distinguishes the following levels of manifestation of the human soul:
*nefesh*, *ruach*, *neshamah*, which correspond to the emanations of the sefirot
in different realms of the soul's development:

<!-- mnemonic: blood, heart, brain -->

- the lower is connected with the body and is responsible for physical
  functioning, the maintenance of life and the operation of the brain —
  corresponds to the sefirah *Malkhut* and further to the sefirot
  *Netzach-Hod-Yesod*;
- the unifying governs emotional state and moral development, primarily in
  relation to people — corresponding to the sefirot *Chesed-Gevurah-Tiferet*;
- the higher corresponds to intellectual development, knowledge of G‑d and the
  created world, including through religion and science — corresponds to the
  sefirot *Chokhmah-Binah-Da'at*.

Also through the sefirah *Keter* occurs the spiritual connection with G‑d,
and through *Malkhut* — low-level quantum connections from the outside.

There are two additional higher levels: *chayah*, received by Adam,
who was created according to the model of *Adam Kadmon*,
and *yechidah*, which manifests upon achieving singularity
with its Divine source.
This level of soul can be received by Mashiach, when his mind
upgrades to the capacity to connect a soul of higher level.

Singularity as union with G‑d has several meanings:

- [Mathematical singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(mathematics)) —
  a point at which a function approaches infinity, that is, G‑d.

- [Cosmological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_singularity) —
  the state of the Universe during its creation by G‑d at the initial moment of the Big Bang.

- [Gravitational singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity) —
  a region within a black hole where the curvature of space-time reaches infinity
  and breaks through outward into infinity, i.e., one can reach G‑d either through
  the separation of soul from body, or by falling into a black hole.  We can also
  observe that the Big Bang is the most striking example of *chesed* as expansion,
  while a black hole represents the extreme degree of *gevurah* as contraction.

- [Technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) —
  a moment in time after which technological progress will become so rapid
  and complex that it will be beyond human comprehension.
  This Singularity, which will come with the arrival of Mashiach —
  will also be a breakthrough to G‑d.

> And the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to G‑d Who gave it.
(Kohelet [12:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.12.7))

After the death of the body, the soul's ability to influence the body ceases,
therefore the soul separates from the dead body and returns to G‑d.
The soul may be repeatedly placed into new bodies in this world
or in other worlds, as it is said:

> I put to death and I bring to life
(Devarim [32:39](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.32.39))

In Kabbalah such a cycle of reincarnations is called
*[gilgul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgul)*,
whose purpose is the rectification of the soul (*tikkun*)
through the soul's interaction with the material world.
<!-- In the *Jewish War* II [8:14](https://www.sefaria.org/The_War_of_the_Jews.2.8.14)
Josephus reported that in the opinion of the Perushim souls are immortal,
but only the souls of the good transmigrate into other bodies. -->
Just as in interaction with the surrounding environment the physical body performs
mechanical work with change of energy, the soul can perform spiritual work
for its development only when it is located in a material body.

The soul is immortal, while the body is transient, as is all the material world.
The meaning of life lies in the perpetual perfection of the soul.
This purpose of the soul's existence can be realized only through the improvement
and repair of the world (*tikkun olam*), to which all souls are connected.
And the Torah establishes the direction of the soul's development through
interaction with the world.

The soul can freely develop only when it has freedom of choice,
[free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will_in_theology#Judaism).
Without free will the commandments of the Torah and the demands
of the prophets would have no meaning, and it would be impossible
to carry out justice in human affairs, as it is said:
{: #free-will title="Free Will"}

> life and death have I set before you, blessing and curse — choose life
(Devarim [30:19](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.30.19))

Assertions about G‑d's omniscience do not contradict free will: G‑d knows all
that will come to pass because the development of the Universe is completely
determined, to the extent that all trajectories of motion of every atom are
predetermined according to the laws of physics.

But non-determinism is introduced by the human through the soul, which
influences the inner state of the Universe from outside the world.
Therefore, all that was previously said concerning the deterministic
operation of the brain remains in force and does not lose its truth.
But additionally, the soul has the ability to correct the operation
of the brain, to introduce indeterminacy, possessing freedom of choice
(within the constraints imposed by various laws — from the laws of nature
to the laws of society).

When a human's soul is not engaged, then by the state of the brain G‑d can
understand such a person's psychology and easily predict their subsequent
actions.  In such a case the body acts in a programmed manner — as if on
autopilot.  Nevertheless, the human retains moral responsibility for the
results of their actions, just as airplane pilots flying on autopilot retain
responsibility for the lives of their passengers.  But the soul always has the
ability to switch to manual control and begin to influence the state of the
brain in such a way that as a result the body would produce actions directed
toward improving the world, taking into account human needs and G‑d's promptings.

When souls do not influence the surrounding world, then the Universe resembles
a film with a predictable plot.  Likewise when life has already been fully
lived, the soul has the ability to view the lived lives as films.

I recall a dream that came to me at age 4: on the way to kindergarten I asked:
“What is all this around us?”  And I received the answer: “This is our world.”
And I said: “No, this is not the world.  This is only a dream.”  And indeed,
for the soul life is like a dream, after which the soul awakens, remembers
and analyzes the content of the “dream”, that is, the life that was lived.
And according to the results comes the Judgment.

The sages held that the Heavenly Court judges a human on the day of their death.
The righteous one, whose good deeds outweigh their sins, is immediately received
into *Gan Eden*.  And the sinner, whose sins outweigh, is sent to *Gehinnom*.

But here an interesting collision arises: we can imagine an absolute righteous
person who never sinned, but for some reason (hypothetically) before his death
planted a time bomb or one triggered by touch.  After death he entered paradise,
and after some time the bomb exploded and killed many people.
Is such a situation possible?

It seems to me that in this case the omniscient G‑d knows that the person
planted the bomb, therefore the Judgment can be postponed until the situation
is resolved: since all people have free will and their souls are undetermined,
there is a probability that someone else will be able to discover the bomb and
disarm it, and then the person's sins are mitigated from murder to attempted
murder.  This is similar to how the Judgment over Cain was postponed until the
Flood (Beresheet Rabbah [32:5](https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.32.5)).

When souls participate in changing the state of the world, the Universe
appears not as a film with a predetermined plot, but rather resembles
a multi-user system, for example,
a [computer game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game)
— with one difference: that life is not a game (the entire world is a game,
but life in the world is not a game), but a serious matter (to be lived with a smile).

In recent times, in connection with the proliferation of digital technologies,
the [computer simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis)
hypothesis is gaining popularity, according to which the world is described as
virtual reality modeled on a computer.  But the term “simulation” has given
nothing new — self-consciousness is explained by the same principles, when
external subjects connect to objects of the Universe.  In reality the Universe
is not a simulation, but a real world with real meaning, where the connected
souls of human beings have the ability of self-perfection.

One of the significant events advancing the worldview of simulation was the
release of the film *[The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix)*.
But this film did not make a particular impression on me, because
I had long been familiar with these ideas, especially from what
I had read 12 years before the release of *The Matrix* and what
subsequently became my most favorite work by my most favorite writer
[Stanisław Lem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanisław_Lem) — his novel
*[The Futurological Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Futurological_Congress)*.

The aforementioned film, though derivative, made popular the expression
“glitch in the Matrix”, which implies that errors,
[software bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug) are possible
in the operation of the Universe.  But I think that the Universe is made so well
that it operates precisely according to programmed rules, therefore any
possibility of errors is completely excluded.

In this world G‑d does not violate physical laws, because the primary
characteristic of quality programming is such an ideal state, when
the program operates exactly as intended, and nothing needs to be fixed.

Therefore there exist only two theoretical possibilities for how so-called
“miracles” may manifest.  The first possibility is when miracles are explicitly
programmed as exceptions to the rules of the program's operation.

For example, in the Talmud (Pesachim [54a](https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.54a.7),
and also Pirkei Avot [5:6](https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.5.6))
lists are given of various miraculous things that were created on the eve of
the first Sabbath at twilight: the tablets, the staff of Moshe, the manna, etc.
Theoretically this is possible — when creating a program one can embed triggers
that activate upon reaching specified conditions, which consequently produce
unexpected action.

In modern computer applications such a capability is called *tzafun* —
by analogy with the piece of matzah called the *afikoman*,
which on Pesach is hidden until the conclusion of the Seder.
A similar meaning of ‘hidden’ is found in the official name
for such a concealed function in a computer program, which is called
*[tachmin](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/ביצת_פסחא_(מדיה))*.

The second possibility for performing miracles is to connect directly with
a [debugger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger) to the process memory
and manually alter the internal state of the Universe.  Usually interference
with a program's operation is required when errors are discovered
in order to correct them.  [Hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker)
also penetrate into programs to change the course of their operation.
The word *hacker* has two primary meanings:

1. a programmer who achieves a creative goal through an unusual, elegant method;
2. a security breaker, cracker.

Here is meant the first, original meaning.

It is possible that actions involving the direct transformation of the
inner state of the Universe had to be performed at least three times.
This is indicated by the expression “G‑d created” (*bara*), which appears
in the first chapter of Beresheet three times and correspondingly describes
three distinct acts of creation:

1. the creation of the Universe ([1:1](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.1)) —
the programming and launch were performed manually.
<!-- But this was not an emergency situation, unlike the following two. -->

2. the creation of life ([1:21](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.21)) —
the genesis of life in water on Earth, when from inanimate matter
emerged [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis),
and biological evolution began.  This was such an extraordinary event
that for the initial endowment of inanimate matter with life and the initiation of the
evolutionary program of life on Earth, Divine intervention may have been required.

3. the creation of the human ([1:27](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.27)) —
the creation of *[Homo sapiens sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominization)*
from the ape and endowing it with reason, self-consciousness, abstract thinking,
speech, intellectual capabilities.  If we continue the comparison of the
human body with a computer, then just as an
*[upgrade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upgrade)*
is performed when hardware and software are updated, so too
an upgrade of the brain and mind was performed so that
the human *neshamah* would have no limitations for development.
<!-- In the human embryo, the soul exists at the level of *nefesh*
as in animals, and at birth is upgraded to the level of *neshamah*. -->
After this began the history of human civilization with the creation of writing
approximately 5–6 thousand years ago, which corresponds to the Jewish calendar.

It is interesting that the establishment of the Moon's orbit is not included in
the enumeration of acts of creation.  This means that such an improbable event
as the [collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant-impact_hypothesis)
of two celestial bodies, which resulted in the formation of the Moon —
critically important for the possibility of life on Earth — this event was
programmed with astounding precision before the launch of the Universe.

Generally speaking, at present there exist two scientific hypotheses which are
neither confirmed nor refuted, and in which it makes sense to believe at the
current stage of understanding the Universe.  These two key hypotheses are
as follows:

1. The universe is a quantum computer.
2. Consciousness has a quantum nature.

<!-- These hypotheses are closely connected with the hypothesis of the
existence of G‑d.  All these hypotheses are scientific, because they
satisfy the requirements set forth for
a [hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis).  On one hand, agnostics
accept that the hypothesis of G‑d's existence has not yet been proven, despite
the fact that this hypothesis sheds light on many matters.  And in this they can
be understood — indeed, to prove it completely is rather difficult.  But the
position of atheists is absolutely absurd — they invent various meaningless
things like a flying [teapot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_teapot)
or [pasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster).
By analogy with the criteria of scientific validity for a hypothesis — this
looks as if impostors had come to scientists and begun proposing hypotheses
about the real existence of various fairy-tale creatures, elixirs, perpetual
motion machines, etc.  It does not occur to them that the existence of G‑d
provides answers to many questions.  But their “hypotheses” are
pseudoscientific by definition. -->

At present it makes sense to believe that, taking into account humanity's
contemporary knowledge of computer architecture and the organization of
computational processes, it is most probable that reality represents the result
of a program continuously executed on a gigantic computer.  In the beginning
the basic algorithms of the Universe's functioning were established, and all
subsequent evolution proceeded automatically.

And in accordance with the hypothesis of the quantum nature of consciousness, by
connecting at the quantum level to the neurons of the brain, the soul has
the ability to alter the state of brain cells and thereby ensures free will.
Thus, the entire world is a computer, and humans within it are connected to souls.
And souls connected from the outside have the ability
to influence the world from the inside.

<!-- In connection with this it is interesting to note that
in a deterministic Universe it is possible to generate only
[pseudorandom numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator).
And the source of true random numbers can be a human being.  But here too
not everything is straightforward.  For example, in such games as
*[rock, paper, scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors#Algorithms)*
a computer is capable of finding certain patterns in the logic of a human's
choice of the next move, so that the computer is capable of always winning.
A human's choice is influenced by the external environment, past memories, etc.
For example, when my beloved girl created a program in assembly language in which
it was necessary to specify a set of random numbers, the most frequently used was
her favorite number 15. -->

Physical experiments show that reality becomes concrete only upon observation.
From this may follow such an interesting supposition that the world is optimized so
that only before a human is about to look is the state of the observed object
calculated.  This resembles numerous methods of program optimization, for example:

1. [Sparse matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix)
can be applied to optimize memory use in those regions
of the Universe which are not accessible to observation.

2. [Lazy evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation),
where computations of the state of inaccessible parts of the Universe
can be deferred until the moment of their observation.

3. [Eye-based ray tracing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)#Reversed_direction_of_traversal_of_scene_by_the_rays),
where ray tracing is performed in the direction opposite to the movement of photons,
i.e., from the eyes toward the source, and only then is its state calculated.

On this topic, the dialogue between Einstein and Bohr is remarkable:
“G‑d does not play dice” — “Albert, don't tell G‑d what to do”, as well as
Einstein's question: “Do you really think that the Moon exists only
when you look at it?”  I think not only the Moon is calculated, but also the
billions of stars observed by humans.  And the far side of the Moon could have
remained uncalculated until the launch of an artificial lunar satellite.

Since ancient times, philosophers have been occupied with the question of
whether human identity is preserved when all the cells of the human body are
constantly renewed, including brain cells.  In my opinion, as long as the same
soul remains connected to the neurons, human personality remains unchanged.
This is because the soul represents a global unique identifier from an infinite
set, which is assigned to an object of the material world — the brain.  (In set
theory, Cantor introduced the concept of the cardinality of an infinite set,
denoted by the letter [aleph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_number) — ℵ.
We can say that ℵ<sub>0</sub> denotes the infinity of a countable set in
“breadth”, while a higher index denotes the infinity of uncountable sets in
“depth”, as for example, real numbers are obtained by infinite division of the
interval between adjacent whole numbers, etc.  And in Kabbalah, the letter
ℵ denotes the infinity of *Ein Sof*.)  Therefore the soul is eternal, like
any number from an infinite sequence, and does not disappear anywhere.

For the same reason stated above, while human intellect may be reproduced on
a computer in the form of artificial intelligence in the near future, human
consciousness, which is connected to the soul, can never be uploaded to
a computer.  Even if one succeeds in constructing an exact molecular copy of
a human body or growing a genetically identical clone and implanting in its
brain all the memories of the original, still a quantum system cannot be copied
without destruction, and this means that the copy will not be able to receive
the same soul.

Also of interest is this question: after freezing a human body cryonically,
if its soul departs to the next body, will the soul return to the old body
after thawing?  The answer is evident: while the body remains in a cryopreserved
state, and the possibility of continuing life after thawing remains,
the soul continues to be connected to the brain, as during sleep.
<!-- Because such a situation is impossible, that the soul would disconnect
during freezing, and after thawing a soulless zombie would awaken.  -->

Experiments in the separation of brain hemispheres are known, resulting in
the observed division of consciousness.  In this case I think that the soul
is connected to all brain cells, and can control the divided consciousnesses
simultaneously in both hemispheres.  But here questions of morality and ethics
in scientific research begin to arise.

The task of religion is to serve as a moral compass in scientific research.
It could be said that the principal guideline in the relationship between
religion and science is as follows:

- science without religion is like a body without a soul;
- religion without science is like a soul without a body.

Or as Einstein said: “science without religion is lame,
religion without science is blind”.

Only thus can we approach G‑d through science —
conducting experiments with attention to guidance from G‑d.

| And G‑d completed by the seventh day all the work which He had made, and He rested on the seventh day from all the work which He had made. | וַיְכַ֤ל אֱלֹהִים֙ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִ֔י מְלַאכְתּ֖וֹ אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֑ה וַיִּשְׁבֹּת֙ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִ֔י מִכָּל־מְלַאכְתּ֖וֹ אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָֽׂה |

{: .chapter #shabbat-comp title="Shabbat and Computers"}

When I had already been observing Shabbat for an extended period and no
longer ever worked on Sabbaths, once on Friday evening I lingered over
urgent work on the computer.  The time for the beginning of Shabbat was
approaching, yet the work still remained unfinished.  And here is what
I devised: in the settings I disabled the screensaver so that it would not
automatically dim the screen.  Then on the screen I arranged several pages of
the program's source code.  Using small font, I managed to fit the entire text
of the program that needed to be completed onto the screen.  Thus, I could
look at the screen without touching the keyboard, which even according to
the strictest opinions is not considered work and does not fall into any of the
39 categories of *melakhot*.  For example, in precisely the same way synagogues
have computer screens hanging on the walls showing information about prayer
times, and these screens continue displaying content during Shabbat, and everyone
can look at them and receive information from the screen.  For this same reason
it is permitted to use light that was turned on before the beginning of Shabbat.

And so, priding myself on my cleverness, I continued to gaze upon the
program text on the screen, not touching the computer keyboard.  Shabbat was
approaching, yet I did not touch the computer, but simply sat and looked
at the screen.

Then suddenly the unexpected occurred — a perfectly functioning computer shut
itself down.  The electricity had not gone out, there were no software problems,
but simply the physical contact on the computer's power button had been disconnected.
I know that various cases happen, and I too over several decades of using many
different computers had encountered different cases, but nothing like this had
ever happened before.  It was clearly visible that it was as if someone had
pressed the button and shut off the computer immediately after the beginning of
Shabbat.  And then I realized that the activity I was engaged in was
displeasing to G‑d.

After this I began to analyze what exactly constitutes the essence of that
undesirable action.  Why, despite the fact that this action was not in the
list of melakhot compiled by the sages, G‑d nonetheless forbids engaging
in it on Shabbat.

Everything becomes clear when we recall the words of the Torah that
G‑d completed by the seventh day all the work which He had made.
G‑d spent six days programming the Universe, and on the Friday evening
[deployed to production](https://www.google.com/search?udm=2&q=Friday+evening+deploy+to+production),
and went to rest.

In G‑d's program, bugs are impossible, therefore there was no problem
to do this, and on the Sabbath there would be no need to fix any discovered bugs.
But in general, an important rule concerning programmers,
admins and all devops: under no circumstances should one
perform [deployment to production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_deployment)
on a Friday evening, because with a probability close to 100%,
errors that cannot be fixed for more than a day will inevitable
surface during Shabbat.

So by analyzing the essence of programming, we can understand from what
precisely G‑d rested on the seventh day, and from what one must rest
on Shabbat, following the commandment to walk in the ways of G‑d
(Devarim [8:6](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.8.6),
[10:12](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.10.12)) and to be like Him in all
matters (Devarim [28:9](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.28.9)).

<!-- Since one of the qualities of G‑d is programmer, and there is a commandment
to emulate G‑d in all things, we could even say that engaging in programming as
one of the manifestations of G‑d is a mitzvah. -->

Programming is a continuous process of
[decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making),
a lengthy process of seeking solutions to numerous problems, where the word
*problem* characterizes a state that differs from the desired one.

We can say that at the beginning of a project the problem is
the very fact of the absence of the needed result — in accordance with
[TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) methodology,
when first a test is written that fails because the required functionality has
not yet been implemented.  For this same reason such concepts as *development*
and *fixing* (*tikkun*) are often identical, because development through
fixing is required when the current state does not yet correspond to the
established goal.

To solve global problems of high level, in accordance with
[top-down design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design#Programming),
they are broken down into several more detailed problems.
In turn, each intermediate problem is broken down into multiple
smaller subtasks, each of which requires the search for and adoption
of micro-solutions.

Each individual decision consists in choosing from various options among several
alternative possibilities.  In this process, the freedom of choice granted to
the soul is activated.  It is engaged in the process of any creativity
whatsoever, and programming is also an art.
<!-- For example, a well-known monograph is titled *The Art of Programming*. -->

Thus in solving a task, the problem is divided into several levels.  After
finding the solution to one problem, the next task is then taken from the
priority list and contemplation of the solution to the next problem begins.
And such an iterative process continues throughout the entire implementation
of the project.

The complete process of implementing each task consists of two recurring stages:

1. first the main stage — contemplating the task and making decisions regarding its implementation;
2. then writing the program by typing text on the keyboard.

When Shabbat began, I was engaged only in the first stage of programming,
but not the second.  Nevertheless, it turned out that it is precisely
decision-making that is forbidden on Shabbat.

All known explanations of the commandments and cases from the Torah
confirm this prohibition with precision:

> Remain each in your place, let no one go out from his place on the seventh day.
(Shemot [16:29](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.16.29))

If one begins to venture beyond the bounds of a settled place,
there arises the danger of needing to plan a route of movement,
and the choice of direction involves decision-making,
including at road junctions.

> You shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the Sabbath day
(Shemot [35:3](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.35.3))

The kindling of fire is connected to making micro-decisions: one must decide
how best to arrange the paper, how to place kindling and wood upon the paper,
where to bring the match, where to blow upon the flame, and many other
decisions.  This is also connected to the prohibition of executing court
decisions on Sabbath (Yevamot [6b-7a](https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.7a)).

> And they found a man gathering wood on the Sabbath day
(Bamidbar [15:32](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.15.32))

Gathering wood also includes making decisions.  When I lived in the forest,
it was necessary to gather wood to kindle the stove (not on Sabbath).
For this, first, one needs to choose the direction in which one plans to move
during this work.  Further, before picking up a branch, one needs to decide:
if the twig is too small — we don't take it, when the branch is larger — one
needs to decide how to grasp it most conveniently together with other branches.
The form of branches is non-uniform, therefore one needs to decide how best to
take hold.  At the end of gathering one needs to optimize the process, so as to
carry away the maximum possible quantity of branches at once — one needs to
decide how to grasp a pile of wood or bundle of wood most conveniently, how to
optimize the arrangement of the load, how to distribute the weight so that the
maximum quantity of wood could be carried away at once.  Then one needs to
decide how most optimally to arrange first in a pile, and then in what order
to add to the fire.

That is, in Bamidbar it was known that this human was preparing to kindle fire
with the gathered wood, and thus he was violating several Sabbath prohibitions:
(1) he went out from his place,
(2) to gather wood,
(3) for kindling fire.  Also gathering manna in the wilderness
and preparing it was forbidden for this same reason
(Shemot [16:27-29](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.16.27-29)).

In the present time few types of work remain that do not require
numerous decisions.  For example, even when a human simply digs a ditch,
this requires making decisions: if a tree root is encountered — one must
decide from which side to cut it; if a stone is encountered — one must
decide from which side to dig around it and how to extract it, etc.
The same is true regarding plowing and harvesting
(Shemot [34:21](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.34.21)).

In the days of Nehemiah the Sabbath was being profaned by the following actions
(Nehemiah [13:15-22](https://www.sefaria.org/Nehemiah.13.15-22)):

- pressed grapes in the winepresses;
- carried sheaves;
- loaded upon donkeys wine, grapes, figs and other burdens;
- traded in fish and other wares.

And Nehemiah commanded to lock all the gates, so that no burden would pass
through on the Sabbath day.  And he told the Levites that they should guard the
gates on Sabbaths.  Nehemiah added nothing to the Torah with this prohibition
on trade, for both the selection of goods and haggling over prices involve
making decisions, when they negotiate at what price to sell and buy.  He simply
confirmed how the commandment of Shabbat observance should be fulfilled.
The prophets likewise warned of this, for example, Yirmeyahu in
[17:21-22](https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.17.21-22) requires not to carry
burdens on the Sabbath day. <!-- including from houses and through gates -->

During the time of the Second Temple, on Shabbat it was forbidden not only to
wage war, but also to conduct peace negotiations (Josephus, *The War of the
Jews* IV [2:3](https://www.sefaria.org/The_War_of_the_Jews.4.2.3)), despite the
fact that this is not included in the list of 39 melakhot recorded later by the
sages in the Mishnah.  And here too it is clear that already then it was known
that conducting negotiations is connected with making decisions.

These examples show that in antiquity the Jews were already familiar
with the general principle of prohibiting activity connected with
decision-making on the Shabbat.

We can attempt to understand the reasons for such a prohibition.  Sabbath
prohibitions are described by the term *machshevet*, sharing a root with the
words *machshev* (computer) and *machshavah* (thought).  When the soul makes
decisions that alter the state of the brain cells' quanta, it thereby introduces
indeterminacy into the direction of events' development.  This creates a need to
engage additional resources for calculating the consequences of such changes and
computing their influence on the new state of the Universe.  The manifestation
of free will in the form of decisions that the soul produces on the quantum
level changes the direction of the world's development — the consequences
must be recalculated anew.

If the decision for some action is made before Shabbat, then the subsequent
states of the world during Shabbat are predictable, and the direction of
development does not change.  But when a human makes decisions that increase
the world's non-determinism, then the variants of future development must be
recalculated anew.  Therefore, on Shabbat we must preserve the determinism of
the world.

We can imagine that on Shabbat the world as it were enters
[maintenance mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Maintenance_mode&oldid=631302248)
or transitions into
[single-user mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-user_mode),
when the usual multi-user functions are restricted.

| And G‑d blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it, for then He rested from all the work of Creation, which G‑d had made. | וַיְבָ֤רֶךְ אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶת־י֣וֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִ֔י וַיְקַדֵּ֖שׁ אֹת֑וֹ כִּ֣י ב֤וֹ שָׁבַת֙ מִכָּל־מְלַאכְתּ֔וֹ אֲשֶׁר־בָּרָ֥א אֱלֹהִ֖ים לַעֲשֽׂוֹת |
|| (Beresheet [2:3](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.3)) |
{: .chapter #shabbat-car title="Shabbat and Cars"}

Some time after the previous incident, when G‑d turned off the computer so that
I would not engage in programming on Shabbat, another incident occurred.

For a considerable time already I had been observing Shabbat and did not
drive on Sabbaths.  And so once, well in advance before the beginning of
Shabbat, I arrived at a shopping center.  The sun was still high above the
horizon.  But it so happened that I had to remain there longer than planned.
And while I was there, I did not notice how time had flown by.  And when
I emerged from there to the parking lot, the sun had already set.

Then I thought that nothing terrible would happen if, in such an exceptional
situation, I were to drive a car just once immediately after the onset of
Sabbath.  All the more so, since in the list of 39 melakhot there is no
prohibition against driving a car.  Moreover, I recalled that even in
Conservative communities, driving a car on Sabbath is permitted.
<!-- at least for traveling to synagogue -->
In short, I boldly got behind the wheel of the car, started it, and drove off.

Then suddenly, right after beginning to move, the unexpected occurred —
the tire burst right there in the parking lot.

Analysis of the damage revealed that after the beginning of movement, the tire
was punctured by a stabbing or cutting object, creating a through torn opening,
with the blow delivered from the side, at a considerable distance from
the road surface.  Such character of damage testifies that the blow was
delivered deliberately, in order to prohibit driving the vehicle on Shabbat.

After this I began to analyze for what reason it is forbidden to drive a car
on Shabbat.  And then it became clear that this case does not differ from the
previous one: just as programming is a process of continuous decision-making,
driving a vehicle is also connected with continuous decision-making.

For this same reason the Torah forbids distant journeys on the Sabbath.  And
Josephus confirms that this prohibition was indeed observed in antiquity: on
Sabbath days and festivals they did not undertake lengthy journeys and military
campaigns.  And this concerned not only travel on horses, camels and donkeys,
but also when one sets out on foot journeys, because before each successive fork
in the intersections one must make a decision each time: go right — one variant
of the development of further events, left — another, etc.

Even when a person always travels along one familiar route, during
automobile driving one must still continually make choices from several options
and make numerous decisions: when to press the gas, when to brake, when and in
which direction to turn the wheel, e.g.:

- When entering the road from a parking lot, one of the first decisions that
  must be made is whether to yield to vehicles approaching on the main road or
  whether they are still far enough away that one can manage to pull out.
- When the green light begins to flash, one must decide whether it is possible
  to make it through the intersection in time, or whether it is already
  dangerous to continue moving and one must stop.
- When pedestrians approach a crosswalk, one must decide whether they are
  already close enough to the crossing that one needs to stop and let them pass,
  or whether they are still quite far from the crosswalk, and one may drive past.
- If an obstacle arises on the road, one must decide from which side to go around it.
- Even if one resolves beforehand to refrain entirely from making overtaking
  maneuvers, nevertheless along the way one may encounter, for example, a very
  slowly moving vehicle, which it becomes necessary to overtake so to prevent
  a column from forming behind it.  Crawling slowly behind a vehicle is not
  an option — this is what intoxicated drivers do.  They often drive very slowly for
  this very reason — so as not to take risks, considering the consequences of their
  [intoxication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication).
- and so on.

The comparison with intoxicated drivers is very apt.
Based upon this comparison, we can employ such a heuristic
<!--
The Greek word *[heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic)*,
adapted for Jewish needs, becomes the word *Hebrewstic*.
-->
— on Shabbat all actions are forbidden which cannot be performed while
intoxicated, because in both cases the ability of making decisions is
excluded.

It's easy to imagine that on the holiday of Purim one became heavily
intoxicated to such a state where it is impossible to distinguish
between *Baruch Mordechai* and *Arur Haman*.  Or became so drunk with
wine or sheichar that it is impossible to distinguish between pure and impure,
<!-- BTW, a riddle: is sheichar *kosher le‑Pesach*? --> impossible to
decide what is holy and what is mundane
(Vayikra [10:9-10](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.10.9-10)).  Thus, all actions
that may not be performed in such a state are also forbidden on Shabbat.

For example, can one drive a car while intoxicated?  No,
[driving under the influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence)
is a serious crime and strictly forbidden.  Alcohol contains ethanol,
which amplifies the effect of inhibitory neurotransmitters that slow the
electrical activity of the brain.  This impairs the ability to make quick and
appropriate decisions — reaction time slows, and it becomes impossible to
respond to unexpected road situations.  Therefore, one also cannot get
behind the wheel of a car on Shabbat.

Above, the prohibition of programming on Shabbat was mentioned.
And indeed, programming while in a state of severe intoxication
is likewise impossible.
<!-- despite the fact that there exists the humorous concept of
[Ballmer Peak](https://xkcd.com/323/) -->

I recommend to no one becoming intoxicated in order to achieve such a state
wherein one's capacity for decision-making is impaired and correspondingly the
likelihood of violating the Sabbath is diminished, but it suffices simply to
imagine that when a gathering with drinking is planned, if this is done on
a Friday evening or on the Sabbath, then in all likelihood the Sabbath
will not be violated.

Another heuristic — to ensure that there is no possibility of concentrating on
conscious decision-making, one can keep count in their mind: one, two, three, four,
five, …  When the mind is occupied with counting or reading, even listening to
audiobooks, lectures, etc., one cannot drive unconsciously when attention is not
fully concentrated on the traffic situation.

For this same reason, one must not be distracted by a smartphone.  When drivers
are distracted by mobile phones, in critical moments they must manage to quickly
switch attention back to driving in order to make decisions on how to resolve
the arising danger.  Therefore, whoever is distracted while driving, violates
traffic rules.  And violation of the Sabbath is no different from this.

When an intoxicated person needs to get home, this problem is resolved
by taking a taxi or bus, accordingly the behavior of one who observes
the Sabbath should not differ.

Not all languages have explicit distinction between these entirely different
actions.  In English both these actions are designated by the same word
*drive* with different meanings:

- [vehicle operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving);

- riding as a passenger in a vehicle along a pre-planned route.

In the latter case, there is no violation of the Sabbath through decision-making.

It is also interesting here to consider such a hypothetical situation:
if there were no other cars on the streets at all, and no pedestrians walked
across the crosswalks, then there would be no obstacles to driving a car along
a long-familiar route.  But such unrealistically ideal conditions are
not considered further.

It is clear that refraining from driving a personal automobile brings great
inconvenience to one who is accustomed to driving on Sabbaths.  But soon
this problem will be resolved through the use of autonomous vehicles,
[self-driving cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car).

By the grace of G‑d, the aforementioned incident with the punctured tire
occurred directly next to a tire repair shop, and within a day everything was
easily fixed, thus avoiding unnecessary troubles.
<!-- When the Sabbath is violated unintentionally, it is permitted
to continue the violation until the end of the Sabbath, but only on condition
that one strives not to permit such occurrences in subsequent Sabbaths.
In Shulchan Arukh Orach Chayim
[568](https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.568.1) this is called
by the word איבד — when the violated Sabbath is lost. -->
This means that this incident was not a punishment, but only a warning.
Had I ignored this warning and continued to drive on the Sabbath,
then after the warning there would have come severe punishment.

Just as when driving a car one must maintain distance from the vehicle ahead,
so too must one maintain a temporal distance before the onset of Shabbat, and
arrive home early, so as not to cause an “accident” by violating the Sabbath.
Sometimes I took great risks and arrived home five minutes before the beginning
of Shabbat, but since then I have striven to arrive early.

Thus, all these cases are similar to
[experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment)
that confirm a hypothesis, just as, for example, the
[Poincaré conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincaré_conjecture)
proven by Grigory Perelman became a theorem.

I conduct experiments, but do not repeat them due to danger to life, for after
a warning punishment may follow, therefore my experiments are not connected with
science, but are faith in the fact that G‑d communicates His instructions
through significant events in human life, and the task of the human being
is to correctly interpret the hints given by G‑d.

<!--
My interpretation of scientific achievements, like my interpretation of texts.
As an engineer I use scientific knowledge in programming, and in precisely
the same way I use scientific knowledge when writing this book.
-->

In the example described above, to confirm the hypothesis of punishment for
violating the Sabbath, I would have to get behind the wheel of a car on the
Sabbath and accelerate to a speed greater than 100 km/h.  But this would be
a violation of the commandment in Devarim
[6:16](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.16) not to test G‑d.  Therefore,
judging by past experience and extrapolating it into the future, it is clear
that with 100 percent probability such an experiment would end in a fatal crash.

It is known that science requires sacrifices.  Many scientists have sacrificed
their lives in the pursuit of scientific research.

For example, the renowned researcher of X-ray radiation, pioneering radiologist
[Elizabeth Fleischman-Aschheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Fleischman) —
a year after the discovery of X-rays she established a laboratory to study the
possibilities of their practical application, and sparing not her own health,
continued to work, exposing herself to the rays.  As a result of her work she
achieved great success, but at the same time undermined her health and died
from severe consequences.

It is also well known that there are many cases where physicians have tested
new medicines upon themselves.  All of this constitutes outstanding examples
of self-sacrifice for the sake of establishing scientifically confirmed truths.
But nonetheless we must strive to avoid unnecessary sacrifices.

| And G‑d appeared to him in the grove of Mamre, while he was sitting at the entrance of his tent in the heat of the day.  And he lifted up his eyes and saw: behold, three humans were standing near him | וַיֵּרָ֤א אֵלָיו֙ יְהֹוָ֔ה בְּאֵלֹנֵ֖י מַמְרֵ֑א וְה֛וּא יֹשֵׁ֥ב פֶּֽתַח־הָאֹ֖הֶל כְּחֹ֥ם הַיּֽוֹם בוַיִּשָּׂ֤א עֵינָיו֙ וַיַּ֔רְא וְהִנֵּה֙ שְׁלֹשָׁ֣ה אֲנָשִׁ֔ים נִצָּבִ֖ים עָלָ֑יו |
|| (Beresheet [18:1-2](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.18.1-2)) |
{: .chapter #angels title="Angels"}

Once on Yom Kippur I observed a strict fast, and became so famished without
food or drink that I could barely stand on my feet, weakened and on the verge
of fainting from hunger.

And so in such a state I was reading the concluding prayer.  Suddenly a little
fruit fly came flying toward me and landed directly on the line I was reading on
the page of the siddur.  When I finished reading to the end of the page, I began
carefully turning the page.  The fly took off into the air, and when I turned
the page, it sat down again on the next page.  And so it continued for a long
time: I would turn the pages, and the fly would take flight and settle again on
the next page.  And so it flew from page to page.  There was such a feeling that
an angel was looking through the fly's eyes and checking which prayers I was
reading.  This incident led me to reflect upon the nature of angels.

Angels can inhabit living beings.  Physically this occurs such that just as
human souls are connected to brain neurons at the quantum level, so too do
angels have the ability to connect to those same brain neurons and alter their
state, creating new thoughts in the brain.  Thus after connecting, an angel
can send a particular impulse to the brain in the form of a thought.
<!-- Sometimes for important thoughts this is called *bat‑kol*. -->
But the human retains freedom of choice in reacting to the received thought.
If the human soul finds nothing wrong in it, then it may begin to perform
corresponding actions.

For example, in the case when three humans came to Avraham, the matter appeared
thus: G‑d required to convey information to Avraham and Sarah.  For this He sent
ministering angels.  Angels are autonomous entities, acting according to a given
program and sent to humans to carry out G‑d's assignments, that is, angels are
G‑d's messengers, executing commands.  In the TaNaKh the word מלאך (*mal'akh*)
has the primary meaning of *messenger*.
<!-- Decades ago I was already explaining to my beloved girl
that angels are subroutines. -->

In computer science, the corresponding concept is called a
[software agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent) or
[intelligent agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent).
These are special programs capable of executing assigned tasks autonomously.
<!-- And according to Aristotle, as the Rambam observed —
[active intellect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_intellect). -->

And so when the angels received their assignment from G‑d, they connected to the
minds of three chosen men and inspired within them thoughts of what needed to be
done: where to go and what to say.  These people found nothing objectionable in
the thoughts they received, therefore they came to Avraham and Sarah.

In Bava Metzia [86b](https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.86b.20) it is said that
these angels, which guided the humans, were Michael, Gabriel and Raphael.
Michael through a human came to deliver the glad tidings that Sarah would have
a son.  Raphael came to heal Abraham after circumcision — this means that the
human whom the angel guided was a physician.  And Gabriel's task was to see
how many righteous ones remained in Sodom.

Naturally, as with all humans having a physical body, these
individuals could both eat and drink, as it is written in Beresheet
[18:8](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.18.8),
[19:3](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.19.3).  Only additionally they followed
thoughts inspired by angels at G‑d's behest.  That is, an angel connects to
a human's mind, creates a thought about the need to go to a certain place, and
compels them to perform a certain action there.  And it implants in the human's
mind the words that need to be spoken.  Thus angels guide humans in the
direction desired by G‑d.

And so, after the meal two of them, namely Gabriel and Michael, continued
their way to Sodom to Lot.  Of them, Michael's task was to warn Lot of the
imminent fall of the [meteorite](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97778-3).
G‑d knew at what moment in time the meteorite's trajectory would intersect
with that place on Earth, therefore He sent angels to warn the righteous.
<!-- In the same way G‑d gave the prophet Yonah the task to go and warn
the inhabitants of the city. -->

<!-- It is quite possible that similar warnings were sent in cases of other
catastrophic events.  For example, the Lisbon earthquake of 1755 that gave rise
to numerous theological discussions, etc. — it is possible that through
prophetic faculties or even by observing animal behavior one could have foreseen
the catastrophe and been saved, but the signs were not believed or were not
given proper significance. -->

The Torah contains numerous examples of how angels help G‑d influence not only
humans, but indeed all living beings:

> And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and behold, a ram, caught in the thicket by its horns
(Beresheet [22:13](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.22.13))

When Avraham was about to sacrifice Yitzchak, an angel connected to the mind of
an animal and directed it into the thick thicket directly behind the place of
sacrifice, where the animal became caught and diverted Avraham's attention
from Yitzchak to itself.

<!-- Similarly, Balaam's donkey
in Bemidbar [22](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.22). -->

And in Daniel [6:22-23](https://www.sefaria.org/Daniel.6.22-23),
G‑d sent an angel to shut the mouths of the lions, and they caused no harm.

<!-- When angels dwell within birds and insects, one may say that angels have
wings.  And in mosquitoes, ticks, cockroaches, and serpents dwells Satan. -->

> He shall send His angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there
(Beresheet [24:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.24.7))

The angels, by the will of G‑d, so skillfully regulated human actions that at
the very moment when Eliezer arrived at the well, Rivkah approached that exact
same place.  This was also aided by Eliezer's prayer requesting that G‑d provide
a favorable opportunity (Beresheet [24:12](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.24.12)).
After this request, G‑d gave instruction to the angels to influence the actions
of the participants in such a way as to orchestrate their meeting at a specific
place at a specific time.  In my life too there have been many such instances
when I requested help, and G‑d charged angels to direct people to me
even in the most incredible situations.

> And he dreamed a dream: a ladder was set upon the earth,
and the top of it reached to heaven, and behold,
the angels of G‑d were ascending and descending on it.
(Beresheet [28:12](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.28.12))

This vision delineates the principle of angelic action: to transmit information
from G‑d, angels descend into the mind through a channel of communication, which
in the dream was shown in the image of a ladder.  And in the reverse direction,
angels convey requests and prayers from human beings.

> And Yaakov went on his way, and the angels of G‑d met him
(Beresheet [32:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.32.2))

> And Yaakov sent messengers to Esav in the land of Seir
(Beresheet [32:4](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.32.4))

In these passages the meaning of the word *messengers* is clearly seen:
in the first case the angels are messengers of G‑d and compel people
to carry out G‑d's commands, while in the second case (whether these
were the same people or others matters not) they are messengers of Yaakov
and fulfill his assignments.  Sometimes to distinguish between these meanings,
the TaNaKh particularly emphasizes the concept *messenger of G‑d*,
<!-- as *mal'akh Adonai* or *mal'akh Elohim* --> while a messenger
of humans is customarily called *shaliach*.

> And Yaakov was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn
(Beresheet [32:25](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.32.25))

Some human under the influence of an angel in the darkness attacked Yaakov and
in the struggle dislocated Yaakov's hip joint.  Then the angel put into the
attacker's head words to pronounce, including the name Israel.  This angel is
also mentioned in Hoshea [12:4-5](https://www.sefaria.org/Hosea.12.4-5).
Just as the angel refused to pronounce his name in Beresheet
[32:30](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.32.30), so too in Shoftim
[13:18](https://www.sefaria.org/Judges.13.18) the angel did not tell
his name to Manoah.

<!--
> And an angel of G‑d appeared unto him (Shoftim [6:12](https://www.sefaria.org/Judges.6.12))
-->

> the man of G‑d, whom You did send, let him come again unto us,
and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born
(Shoftim [13:8](https://www.sefaria.org/Judges.13.8))

When Manoah and his wife encountered the angel who assisted them in the birth
of Shimshon, this angel appeared as a human, such that they did not immediately
understand that it was an angel.
<!-- Although for understandable reasons the commentators sought not to
emphasize this fact, according to the peshat it is clear that this man
took the most direct part in this “immaculate conception”. -->

<!--
> And the cows went straight along the way, …
and turned not aside to the right or to the left
(Shmuel I [6:12](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.6.12))

That is, angels governed the cattle.
-->

<!--
> And concerning the donkeys that were lost to you three days ago,
do not be troubled about them, for they have been found.
(Shmuel I [9:20](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.9.20))

The donkeys were lost also by the will of the angels, so that Shaul would go to
seek them, and Shaul himself was directed by an angel to the city of Shmuel.
-->

> But they mocked the messengers of G‑d, and despised His words,
and scoffed at His prophets
(Divrei ha‑yamim II, 36:16) II [36:16](https://www.sefaria.org/II_Chronicles.36.16))

In some cases G‑d sends thoughts to people through angels, and in special cases
transmits thoughts directly, which is why prophets are often called messengers.
<!-- And sometimes to animals directly as well, for example, sent hornets
in Devarim [7:20](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.20). -->

Not all angels are white and fluffy — some are destined to carry out the dirty work.
{: #satan title="Satan"}

Some of them are messengers of death and are called *mal'akhei mavet*
(Mishlei [16:14](https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.16.14)),
in sing. *mal'akh ha‑mavet*.  In Iyyov [33:22](https://www.sefaria.org/Job.33.22)
the word *memitim* refers to angels preparing to bring death.

The executor of punishments is called *mashchit*, *mal'akh ha‑mashchit* —
the [destroying angel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroying_angel_(Bible)),
exterminator, annihilator, who carries out the punishment, executes the sentence.

> And G‑d will go forth to smite the Egyptians, and will see the blood upon the
lintel and on the two doorposts, and G‑d will pass over the door, and will not
let the destroyer to come into your houses to smite.
(Shemot [12:23](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.12.23))

When G‑d saw that the door was not marked, He allowed the destroying angel to
strike the inhabitants of unprotected dwellings.  This occurred through the
spread of an epidemic of deadly disease, i.e., the destroying angel, having the
same capacity as all angels to connect to human minds, directed already infected
people or animals toward potential victims, making them carriers of the virus,
as it is said:

> and I will pass over you, and there shall be no plague among you to destroy you
(Shemot [12:13](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.12.13))

In this passage the word *negef* is used, which also means epidemic and pestilence.

As the angel of destruction struck the firstborn of Egypt, so too did it later
strike 185 thousand Assyrians in the Assyrian camp
(Melakhim II [19:35](https://www.sefaria.org/II_Kings.19.35),
Divrei ha‑yamim II [32:21](https://www.sefaria.org/II_Chronicles.32.21)),
spreading among them an infectious disease with high mortality.

Another example of the actions of the destroying angel is the story recounted
in Shmuel II [24](https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.24)
and Divrei ha‑yamim I [21](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.21).
King David commanded a census of the inhabitants of Israel and Judah without
necessity, <!-- as when collecting a half-shekel --> but simply out of vanity.
As punishment for this transgression, pestilence began in the land (*dever* —
epidemic, plague, pestilence), which destroyed 70 thousand people.  And when
the destroying angel (*mal'akh ha‑mashchit*) began to direct people to spread
pestilence in Jerusalem, and had already reached the threshing floor of the
Jebusite, David entreated for mercy, and to halt the epidemic, he purchased
that place on Mount Moriah, and later the Temple was built upon that site.

This case teaches that as a result of any, even the most grievous damage
inflicted by the destroying angel due to the sins of the people's leaders,
there comes a favorable period when *gevurah* (severity, judgment) is replaced
by *chesed* (mercy).  Thus after the Shoah, Israel was reestablished.

<!-- The census of the population through counting the collected shekels
resembles the modern counting of votes by anonymous ballots in elections. -->

Now the question: whence came to David such a destructive thought to
conduct a census of the population.  To this question Divrei ha‑yamim I
[21:1](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.21.1) gives a clear answer:

> Satan rose up against Israel, and incited David to number Israel.

Satan (שָׂטָן) — an angel who carries out the task of instilling evil inclinations
(*yetzer ha‑ra*) in humans, in order to accuse them according to their
responsive reaction.  Just as with all angels, Satan has the ability to send
impulses to the human brain that cause evil thoughts.  But humans always retain
the ability to analyze these thoughts and make a decision whether to follow
them, translating these thoughts into actions, or to try to ignore them, paying
them no heed.  If a human willingly succumbs to Satan's promptings, then they
must answer for their actions at the Judgment, where Satan appears as the
accuser.  In any case, priority always remains with the human soul — humans
always have the ability to resist Satan's pressure, but if there is no
strength of will, then this is the fault of the humans themselves.

> the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth
(Beresheet [8:21](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.8.21))

This speaks to the fact that any person is subject to the influence of Satan.

> at the entrance sin lies, and its desire is toward you, but you must rule over it
(Beresheet [4:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.4.7))

But every person has free will to resist the influence of Satan.

Satan is mentioned in several places in the TaNaKh.
In Zekhariah [3:1-2](https://www.sefaria.org/Zechariah.3.1-2)
Satan stood at the right hand to accuse the priest (הַשָּׂטָ֛ן לְשִׂטְנֽוֹ).
And in Iyyov [1-2](https://www.sefaria.org/Job.1-2)
Satan was permitted to subject Iyyov to trials,
to test whether he would remain faithful to G‑d.

In both cases the word has the definite article — *ha‑satan* (*the satan*),
which corresponds either to a title treated as a proper noun and capitalized
as *the Satan*, or to a personal name *Satan*.  But in other places in
the TaNaKh, as in Bemidbar [22:22](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.22.22),
Tehillim [109:6](https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.109.6),
Divrei ha‑yamim I [21:1](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.21.1),
this word appears without the article as a generic noun.
Therefore hereafter the proper name *Satan* and *satan* without the
definite article meaning any accuser will be used interchangeably
as a name and a title akin to *Pharaoh* (*Paro*).

Also this word can be both masculine and feminine in gender,
therefore the pronouns *he* and *she* may be used interchangeably
as a reminder that satan can affect both men and women.
For example, in Kiddushin
[81a](https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.81a.13-15) it describes how satan
possessed women (in the sense of connecting to the brain and directing them),
in order to seduce Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Akiva, and also possessed a pauper
and directed him to a certain sage, <!-- Plimo, Peleimu --> in order to test
the limits of his hospitality.  And when what is meant is not people to whom
satan is attached, but the autonomous agent itself, then it makes sense
to use the pronoun *it*.

In Bava Batra [16a](https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.16a.8)
Resh Lakish said that the *yetzer ha‑ra* (evil inclination, base impulses),
*satan* (obstacle, adversary, accuser) and *mal'akh ha‑mavet*
(angel of death) — these are one and the same angel, who first tempts,
then accuses, and finally destroys, i.e. in one entity the
provocateur, prosecutor and punisher.
<!-- instigator, juror and executioner -->
This conclusion was reached on the basis that it was commanded
not to kill Iyyov — meaning the angel had such capability (but on
the other hand the Talmud asserts that each angel has one mission).

Midrash Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer
[13:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.13.2) identifies it also
with the angel Samael.  When in the Garden of Eden the serpent (*nachash*)
persuaded the woman to eat the fruit, the serpent was controlled by Samael.
This is visually represented as Samael appearing mounted upon the serpent,
having saddled it like a rider. <!-- see also *Moreh Nevukhim*
[2:30](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_Part_2.30.14) -->

When in Pesachim [112b](https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.112b.6) it is said that
“do not stand in the path of a bull when it comes from pasture, for Satan dances
between its horns”, this means that Satan can gain control over its mind and
threaten the safety of all who encounter it along the way.  It is easy for Satan
to control animals, since animals cannot compare their actions with moral
standards.

Satan, like all angels, has the ability to send brief impulses into the brain,
and a person has the ability to resist this influence.  Unlike animals,
which cannot resist such influence, a human being possesses self-awareness, and
through self-control can recognize the presence of such an impulse and cancel
its consequences — not perform actions corresponding to the suggested thoughts.
But unfortunately, not all people do this — many follow such suggested urges,
not realizing that these urges arose not of themselves, but for their testing.

Many people are susceptible to
[superstitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstition_in_Judaism)
and believe in various omens, not realizing that in this way
they fall under the influence of Satan.

One childhood incident helped me stop fearing omens.
Once, I was in a great hurry to get to a class meeting that I was late for,
so I decided to go to school by a different route, one I had never taken before.
Suddenly on this path, right before me, a black cat ran across the road.  I no
longer had time to turn back in order to go around by another route, as was the
accepted way to react to such an omen.  And so, immediately after this
incident at the meeting I was unanimously elected class leader, which was
a clear manifestation of luck, despite the fact that a black cat crossing
one's path was considered a harbinger of misfortune.
<!-- Or the deer, brought as an example
in Sanhedrin [65b](https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.65b.20). -->

This case greatly surprised me, and since then I have come to regard widespread
omens with skepticism.  For example, I began to notice that the number 13
differs in no way from other numbers and has no influence whatsoever
upon fate: neither positive nor negative.  But if a person fears some number,
considers it “unlucky” or “bringing misfortune”, and strives to avoid it, then
Satan begins to exploit this weakness and will orchestrate such situations so
that this number continually appears before the person and thereby oppresses
them.  Or when a person is in panic fear of black cats, Satan may direct black
cats across the person's path in order to alter the direction of their movement.
And so it occurs with all omens — when a person believes in some omen, Satan so
arranges events that the omen is confirmed, and thereafter the person falls even
more into dependence upon superstitions.
In Pesachim [110b](https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.110b.2) it is said that
the rule is thus: whoever is particular about paired things, demons are also
particular toward him; and whoever is indifferent to pairs, demons are also
indifferent toward him.

> You shall not practice divination or soothsaying
(Vayikra [19:26](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.19.26))

> Do not turn to mediums and to wizards
(Vayikra [19:31](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.19.31))

> Let there not be found among you a diviner, or a sorcerer,
or an enchanter, or one who calls upon spirits
(Devarim [18:10-11](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.18.10-11))

<!-- This prohibition also extends to such a form of divination as
[goral HaGra](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/גורל_הגר"א)
(“the lot of the Gaon Rabbi Eliyahu”), one variant of which appears such
that notes are placed in the books of the Lubavitcher Rebbe.  Interestingly,
after I wrote this down, the following night I had a dream that classmates came
to an Orthodox rabbi, said “Shalom” and asked him to predict their fate.  And so
the rabbi began to do this in the following manner: he would pronounce a word
that came randomly to his head, and then based on this word, through associations,
he would tell what awaited the person next.  -->

In astrology and in horoscopes there is likewise no meaning, for a person's
destiny is not programmed in the arrangement of stars and planets.
Neither the signs of the Zodiac nor biorhythms have influence upon a person's
fate.  Only Satan can instill in a person dependence upon superstitions,
thereby to influence his/her plans and actions, i.e., the dependence is reverse —
the person subconsciously begins to strive toward the fulfillment of the
prediction, and this is called a
[self-fulfilling prophecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy).

<!--
In the mid‑1980s, it was popular to write programs for calculating so-called
“[biorhythms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biorhythm_(pseudoscience))”.
This was one of my first programs, and programming the calculation of physical,
emotional, intellectual cycles was good practice.  But the program's result had
no meaning.

Incidentally, what the rabbis say about gradually diminishing joy and then
increasing joy each day resembles the sinusoidal curve of the emotional cycle
in biorhythms.
-->

In the Talmud it was long observed that the evil eye (*ayin ha‑ra*) can affect
only those people who believe in it.  But it has no influence upon one who pays
no heed to such superstitions.

Likewise, no objects or rituals can attract good fortune or protect
from misfortune.  For example, some consider the mezuzah a talisman,
an amulet that guards against calamities.  Or they collect crumbs, after
havdalah they moisten their pockets with wine for financial abundance,
and other similar *segulot for parnassah*.  But all this has no effect
whatsoever, except psychological — to internally prepare oneself for working
toward achieving a goal or to be more mindful of safety.  This works like a
[placebo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo) effect.

In the TaNaKh there are mentioned cases when an angel appeared to a person in
a dream.  Angels have the ability to connect to the sleeping brain and alter
dreams.  The Talmud observes that despite the fact that such a dream may predict
the future, it will not necessarily come to pass — people can undertake efforts
to prevent it, as did the inhabitants of Nineveh after the prophecies of the
prophet Yonah.  Moreover, when the meaning of a dream is ambiguous, the
realization of the dream depends upon its interpretation — as the dream is
explained, so shall it come to pass.  Therefore, in order to prevent Satan
from realizing an evil portent, one must interpret the dream favorably.

<!--
Previously I had dreams that precisely foretold troubles
that Satan would send upon me on the day following the dream.
-->

Satan has many ways of influencing a person to compel him to commit an error.
Not all errors are harmless.  In Shemot [21:13](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.21.13)
it is said that G‑d permits Satan to ensnare a person and bring about circumstances
such that he may accidentally commit an unintentional act with more serious
consequences.  Hereafter, such serious cases as those caused by
[pilot error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_error) will not be considered.
For understanding the principle, it suffices to examine cases with minor damage.

One example of these are
[speech errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_error), such as the so-called
[Freudian slips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freudian_slip).  Well-known
are instances when, due to such errors, prominent political figures became
objects of ridicule, and their careers were affected as a result.  I too have
had occasions when the first impulse was to take an ill-considered action,
but then came the realization that the initial reaction is not always correct.
The initial impulse is often false due to the influence of Satan, especially
when a person is in a state of stress.
<!-- Satan can obtain complete control over a person for no more than a couple
of seconds.  It is known (Penrose) that the reaction time of consciousness is
two seconds.  Therefore, especially in a state of stress, a person may lose
control over their actions for a time of no more than two seconds.
(Due to this, all manner of slips of the tongue occur.) -->
Only after time has passed, can a person pull themselves together, collect their
thoughts, and begin to act in accordance with the commandments of their soul.
Therefore it is desirable to wait before making a decision, especially if the
problem evokes negative emotions.  For example, it is better not to respond
immediately to mails or comments, but to delay your reactive response,
so as to wait until the negative emotions subside, and then the reply emerges
courteous and thoughtful.

I have been “fortunate” that Satan torments me continuously,
contriving different troubles for me every day.
As stated in Nedarim [32b](https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.32b.1),
the gematria of the word *SATAN* (הַשָּׂטָן) is 364,
i.e., Satan causes trouble every day except for Yom Kippur.
But the advantage is that this provides the opportunity to study the principles
of Satan's activity in all details.  A separate book could be written about
Satan's diverse methods, but it suffices to make generalizations.

<!--
To understand how Satan operates, I can provide a detailed analysis of a single case
for illustration — an insignificant but instructive case, since such coincidences
occurred with me almost every day.  Once after lunch I decided to take a walk
and also pass by my former workplace to see what had changed there over the past
10 years — simply to look at the names of firms on the doors.  It was Sunday and
vacation season, so no one was there.  But when I was already approaching,
suddenly an alarm sounded loudly throughout the entire street.
After some time a security guard car arrived, and when I began to pass by the
first door, they stopped at the door, got out of the car and looked in my
direction.  To avoid unnecessary questioning, I was forced to pass by without
looking toward the door.  When I approached the second door, the guards had
already finished checking the first door and moved to the second.  The situation
repeated with precision down to the smallest details — the guards again looked
at me, and I was forced to pass by without looking in their direction.
And with the third door the same thing repeated.  In general, I had
to leave without seeing anything.

Then I began to ponder how it was possible to orchestrate with such precision —
down to the second — such a coordinated sequence of actions by several people.
There was nothing surprising in the alarm going off — it had often activated
before when a mouse scurried past the motion sensor.  And this time too, Satan
could have directed the mouse toward the sensor as I was approaching that place.
But the main thing was different — when I was approaching there, I noticed
a pedestrian, and to make everything as perfectly ideal as possible, so that
no one would interfere with my stroll there, I decided to wait a bit for a more
suitable moment when no one would be around.  After some time, a man came out
to the place where I was standing to have a smoke.  And there he stands, staring
directly at me, while I stand idle, and I felt uncomfortable — this compelled me
to stop standing and continue moving.  And then everything was so synchronized
that three times I failed to approach the doors.  That is, when that man was
sitting in his office, Satan gave an impulse to his brain: “Why don't I go have
a smoke”.  He found nothing wrong with this thought and went outside precisely
at the moment when the security guards were arriving.

This case is very minor, but it vividly demonstrates how similar cases with
incredible coincidences often occurred according to the same pattern — I would
attempt to do something with utmost perfection, and Satan through its
interference would shatter all plans, thereby causing suffering.

Another lesson that can be drawn from this incident — Satan increases its
influence when there is too much free time.  If I had been running late for
work, I would not have had time to be distracted by such trifles.  This is
confirmed by another incident that occurred in the same place earlier, when
I was still working there.  Once after lunch in the same building, I thought
that after lunch it would be good to take a walk in the vicinity.  But as soon
as I left the building and walked along a long stretch of road, a van stopped
directly in front of me and slowly drove backwards directly in front of me.
Three workers were sitting in the front seat and staring at me intently.
Having walked thus for several meters, I could not endure the absurdity
of the situation, turned around and went back to work.

Or another case when there was much excess time:
once I checked into a hotel by the seashore.
And so I open the window and begin inhaling the fresh air.
Whereupon a truck immediately drives up to the street in front of the hotel
and stops right in front of the window.  Moreover, it doesn't turn off the engine,
and exhaust fumes begin flying straight into the window.
It is clear that the driver is not to blame for being used by Satan.
So meaningless travels also brought problems.

But if one does not wander about idly, and spends all time on work,
then success accompanies.  Only one must endure the hindrances of Satan
such as continuous noise, etc.

There is no point in enumerating all these numerous instances of Satan's
machinations.  I think reading this would be very tiresome — in volume
it could amount to an entire book.  Therefore, what follows are only
the conclusions drawn from analyzing all such cases.
-->

Based on the analysis of various cases, the following conclusions can be drawn:

- In many cases people are not at fault for being used by Satan
to cause trouble for other people.

Often Satan instills in people the urge to perform generally harmless
actions, but ones that cause suffering to others.  <!-- For example, by inciting
rabbis of the past to introduce stringencies, Satan caused numerous problems for
observant Orthodox Jews. -->  When people find nothing wrong with their
intentions, which may be caused by Satan's promptings, they begin to perform
corresponding actions.  This means that we should not be angry at people who,
without evil intent, do something that we may not like.  Knowing this,
I constantly strove to resist Satan's influence, so that my actions would not
bring troubles to other people.

It should be noted that here I speak not of cases when Satan drives one to
real crimes, but only when a person in moments of weakness is unable to resist
evil impulses.  In most cases people commit errors not maliciously, but due to
insufficient self-examination of their actions, or when they fail to react in
time to Satan's promptings before committing foolish acts that bring trouble
to other people.  This helps to understand
[Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor) —
a principle that explains how actions leading to unpleasant consequences more
often arise from unintentional mistakes rather than from malicious intent.

Minor mistakes happen all the time, but at the very least one must have the
willpower to resist the more substantial influence of Satan in serious matters.
There always remains the possibility of exercising willpower to stop when it
is clearly seen that Satan is pushing in a direction leading away from G‑d.

- Satan strengthens its influence when a person has too much free time.  But
when a person is so deeply occupied that they cannot be distracted by trifles,
then Satan has less influence to interfere.  Therefore we must do our work,
paying no heed to Satan's interference — then Satan loses interest.  This
helps against minor troubles, but unfortunately does not save from worse
misfortunes.

- We must always strive to extract benefit from all misfortunes and defeats,
even the most distressing ones, always turning any situation,
even an unfavorable one, to our own advantage:

> Though you intended evil against me, G‑d turned it to good
(Beresheet [50:20](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.50.20))

For example, when Satan disrupts plans, we must immediately restructure
the plans so as to turn the new course of events to our own advantage:

> and the L‑rd, your G‑d, turned the curse into a blessing for you,
for the L‑rd, your G‑d, loves you
(Devarim [23:6](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.23.6))

And indeed, each time when Satan <!-- satan-destroyer, *ha‑mazikin*
(Pirkei Avot [5:6](https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.5.6)) -->
burdened with troubles such that it seemed impossible to endure any longer,
G‑d always intervened and provided a fortunate opportunity for blessed deliverance
from the attacks of Satan.  For G‑d does not permit Satan to burden with trials
beyond what you can bear.

- Excessive perfectionism is destructive — when a person strives to do
everything perfectly, Satan gains more opportunities to disrupt plans.  For
this same reason, we must not postpone beginning a new endeavor until a more
“favorable” time, we must not wait for a more “suitable” moment, a more
“auspicious” day.

Often it happens, especially under stress, that a person wants something to turn
out exactly as intended, for all dreams to come true with precision down to the
smallest detail.  But this does not happen — it always turns out absolutely
differently from how it was envisioned.  Therefore, we should not strive for
perfectionism.  In achieving a goal, we must not reject the imperfect flow of
events in hope of attaining absolute perfection.  We should not attempt to do
more than necessary.

If one deliberately postpones the beginning of an undertaking until some round
date, e.g., until a new month or year, or waits for the arrival of some more
“auspicious” date, then delays create obstacles — for instance, in competition
someone else gets ahead and manages to accomplish the same thing that was
planned.  Also it becomes impossible to maintain a steady pace over an
extended period when an artificial pause was observed before beginning the work.

Interestingly, the Shulchan Arukh
Yoreh De'ah [179:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.179.2)
mentions customs of not beginning matters on Monday or Wednesday,
marrying during the full moon, beginning studies with the new month,
and generally avoiding all that seems inauspicious.  But at the same time
with reference to Hilkhot Avodah Zarah
[11:4](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Foreign_Worship_and_Customs_of_the_Nations.11.4)
it is forbidden to believe in omens, e.g., not stopping when an animal
passes on the right side, not postponing the beginning of a matter
when everything is falling from one's hands, etc.

When we do everything at once, then fortune begins to accompany us.
For example, in critical situations I had to do everything without delays,
paying no heed to the hindrances of Satan, therefore I succeeded in everything
precisely at the last moment.  And indeed, when a person strives toward some
good goal, then Satan cannot interfere — e.g., I always managed to catch
departing transportation at the very last moment, etc.  <!-- Also fortune smiled
in monetary matters — many times when making purchases it turned out I had money
equal to exactly what was needed. -->  Otherwise, after each delay Satan
intervenes and begins to destroy plans.  And when there is a goal to succeed
in time, then I needed to act strictly according to intuition, i.e., by the
will of G‑d angels paved a successful path, and I simply needed not to turn
from it and not to slow down.

Therefore when you have already made a decision and there are no doubts about the
correctness of the choice, then everything must be done immediately — for then
Satan does not have time to arrange obstacles.

In connection with this, it is necessary to mention such an important concept
as *chutzpah*.  The word *chutzpah* often evokes disapproval,
being considered synonymous with impudence or audacity.  But this is incorrect.
{: #chutzpah title="Chutzpah"}

Chutzpah is not impudence, but self-confidence, determination,
<!-- passionarity, --> the ability to ‘catch the wave’,
or in a single word what is called *drive* as a strong motivation,
a driving force, an energy of moving forward.

The attitude toward any object depends upon the manner of its application, e.g.,
by striking with a heavy book one can inflict grievous harm upon a person.  But
when a book is used for its intended purpose and brings benefit, then it becomes
a positive object.  Precisely so with chutzpah.  If it brings no harm, but on
the contrary, contributes to the betterment of the world, then this is
a positive quality, akin to the concept of *enterprise*.

I have had many examples of positive chutzpah.  For example, there is
a long queue.  I approach, assess the situation, and discover a possibility
to avoid the long line, or I find some other solution to the problem
for my own benefit.  Others begin to repeat my actions after me.
Am I a *chutzpan* in this case?  Undoubtedly a chutzpan, but a chutzpan
in the good sense — besides personal benefit, such actions also bring
benefit to other people.  Often I confidently began doing what others did
not dare to do, and others continued what was begun, following after me.

<!-- Often chutzpah manifests vividly when, as a result of a wager, something
must be done on a bet.  For example, an insignificant case, but one I remember
well: at school we wagered who could hit a narrow tube standing on the floor
from above with a thin metal rod.  Everyone tried, aimed for a long time, but
no one could even come close.  Then I walk around and declare with surprise how
it is possible that no one can manage such a simple task: “It's so easy!”  And then
I raise the rod to a great height, turn away and release it without looking —
and it strikes precisely on target.  Or we wagered whether one could draw
a perfect circle by hand.  I declare so confidently that this is very simple,
and then I take a pencil and quickly draw a large absolutely perfect circle —
as if with a compass. -->

The main conclusion — good fortune always accompanies when you believe in
your own strength and act decisively, as if the problem is already solved,
as when the solution of the problem has already become reality, and the needed
result stands before your eyes.

This conclusion applies to many other types of activity as well,
which in most cases are not a
[zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game).
For example, chutzpah is a necessary quality when creating startups
in new directions, when there is not yet any competition,
and even competitors don't lose anything — although there is
nothing reprehensible about fair competition either.
Thus, we can conclude that chutzpah is an engine of progress.
<!-- In this sense, chutzpah is an important attribute of Mashiach. -->

Another illustrative example of the distinction between audacity and chutzpah:
there have been cases when a person's business was seized from them,
and thereafter they created a new business from scratch.
So in such cases, the corporate raiding is mere audacity,
while the business development is chutzpah.

In general, the fundamental principle, just as in our relationship with G‑d —
is not to be impudent, that is, to make full use of all possibilities,
but while remaining within the bounds of morality.

<!--
And the complete opposite of the chutzpan is the *shlimazel* —
one whom Satan torments with particular intensity.
And nothing remains for him but to submit
to his fate as an unlucky one and suffer Satan's blows without complaint.
Even when such a person does not yield to evil inclinations
and leads a righteous life, he has grown accustomed to such a state
and constantly expects misfortunes, as a given reality that cannot be changed.

I first encountered this problem in childhood.  There was one such incident:
at school I was told to bring jigsaws for woodworking class.  So I asked my
father to buy me such jigsaws.  And in the evening he comes home from work
empty-handed and with bitterness tells such a story, that he had gone into the
store and bought the jigsaws I needed.  But at the exit from the store they
slipped from his hands and fell through the bars of the shoe-scraping grate,
so that it was impossible to retrieve them from there.  And asking the shopkeeper
to sell the same ones again would have been foolish.  Having finished this
account, he sorrowfully lamented that he had such misfortune all the time.

And indeed, he spent his entire life thus: traveling back and forth to work by
one route.  And when he deviated from his daily route, unpleasant things would
occur.  For example, once his mother-in-law asked him to sell a television while
she was living at the summer house.  The buyers turned out to be two burly men.
It's easy to imagine such a scene: three men are carrying a television out of
a pensioner's apartment, while at that moment a neighbor comes out to walk
her dog.  It is no wonder that the neighbor thought they were thieves,
shouted loudly, and set her dog upon them.
-->

Antisemites often accused Jews of displaying chutzpah when Jews used their
abilities to improve life.  Jews were accused even when chutzpah was employed
to save their own people.

The finest example of chutzpah in the positive sense is found in the actions of
Queen Esther in saving the Jewish people.  When she boldly came before the king,
she obeyed her intuition, i.e., G‑d provided an opportunity for salvation,
outlining such a sequence of actions that, by following them, it would be
possible to save the Jewish people while avoiding the danger from the
antisemites.  Esther's merit lies in her having fully seized upon this
opportunity, manifesting thereby the highest degree of chutzpah as
resolute adherence to the sole possible path of salvation.

And in our time it is exactly the same.  Satan continuously pressures Israel,
using morally weak people for this purpose.  Satan instills in them all manner
of antisemitic prejudices.  Different people cope with this in different ways.
Independently thinking and educated people, who know how to soberly and
impartially analyze their inclinations, can keep their evil impulses under
control and not succumb to the influence of conspiracy theories.  But those
who are weak-willed and lacking in independent judgment easily fall under
the sway of antisemitic propaganda.

What can be undertaken to avoid all of this?

First the bad news — it is impossible to rid oneself of Satan's attacks by any
means.  Satan constantly attempts to cause problems.  All these obstacles are
intended to create situations where there is a choice: to commit evil and make
the world worse, or to show mercy and advance on the path toward G‑d.

The galut in medieval Europe was necessary as a catalyst for the advancement of
Christian nations toward G‑d.  Satan constantly created situations where, as
with litmus paper, the direction in which nations were moving could be seen by
their attitude toward the Jews.  When crimes were committed against the Jews,
the morality of these states also eroded, so that ultimately they fell into
decline and disintegrated.  At the cost of enormous sacrifices, this task was
accomplished in Europe, and at present the nations of European countries have
achieved a high level of spirituality.

For the fulfillment of the next task of drawing the Muslim nations closer to
G‑d, the Jewish people was directed straight into the very center of hostile
surroundings among Muslim countries for the cultivation within them of tolerance
— one of the principal spiritual qualities required of a person: “Do not do unto
another what you would not wish for yourself”.  And now the majority
of neighboring Arab states have a more tolerant attitude towards Israel.

<!-- Just as Jews were first placed in Christian surroundings, and then in
Muslim ones, to cultivate tolerance among the nations, so too did G‑d direct me
to cultivate tolerance among the Orthodoxes. -->

Satan never gives rest to the righteous.  As was observed in the midrash
Beresheet Rabbah [84:3](https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.84.3),
when the righteous person desires to live peacefully in this world,
Satan comes and accuses: “Is it not enough for the righteous what is prepared
for them in the World to Come, that they should want to live peacefully
in this world?”  And when, for example, in Beresheet
[37:1](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.37.2?with=Rashi) Yaakov desired
to live peacefully, Satan came and inflicted troubles on him according to
the enumeration in Iyyov [3:26](https://www.sefaria.org/Job.3.26):
“no repose” — from Esav, “no quiet” — from Lavan, “no rest” —
because of Dinah, “and trouble came” — because of Yosef.

<!-- My fate mirrors the fate of the entire Jewish people.  Therefore, through
my example I attempted to understand what could be done to ease the Jewish lot.
In my case, G‑d compelled me to observe the necessary minimum — then it became
more bearable. -->

But there is also good news — when we choose the right path in life and strive
to do the right deeds in the right place and at the right time, <!-- chutzpah -->
then G‑d protects us and cares for our safety and prosperity.  If we do not forget
G‑d, then G‑d will continue to protect.  In modern Israel, the majority observes
the commandments of the Torah, following the basic traditions.  It is
precisely for this reason that G‑d continues to support and guard Israel.

How does one live under such constant pressure from Satan?
From all of this, we can draw the main conclusion:

**WE MUST DO GOOD DEEDS, PAYING NO HEED TO THE HINDRANCES OF SATAN**

When I finished typing on the computer the previous line
about the necessity of ignoring the impediments of Satan,
suddenly the computer screen unexpectedly went dark.
But this is not surprising — Satan constantly tries to interfere.
So it was in this case as well — Satan gave an impulse to err,
and instead of the screen recentering button I accidentally
pressed the screen lock button *Lock Screen*.
<!-- instead of *Control-L* (recenter) accidentally pressed *Super-L* (*Win-L*) -->
And so it is all the time — Satan tries to interfere,
but if we strive to do everything correctly,
then the force of Satan's influence is limited,
and then all these attempts can be disregarded.

We must walk firmly upon the appointed path leading to success,
ignoring all manner of obstacles — just as prayer with kavanah
has power when one does not become distracted by hindrances.

| I am not eloquent — neither in the past nor now, for I am heavy of mouth and slow of speech. | לֹא֩ אִ֨ישׁ דְּבָרִ֜ים אָנֹ֗כִי גַּ֤ם מִתְּמוֹל֙ גַּ֣ם מִשִּׁלְשֹׁ֔ם גַּ֛ם מֵאָ֥ז דַּבֶּרְךָ֖ אֶל־עַבְדֶּ֑ךָ כִּ֧י כְבַד־פֶּ֛ה וּכְבַ֥ד לָשׁ֖וֹן אָנֹֽכִי |
|| (Shemot [4:10](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.4.10)) |
{: .chapter #kvad-peh title="Kvad-peh"}

> how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me, seeing that I get tongue-tied
(Shemot [6:12](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.6.12))

> I get tongue-tied, how then shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?
(Shemot [6:30](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.6.30))

The essence of *kvad-peh u‑kvad-lashon* is the inability to properly
construct speech, to clearly express one's thoughts in words
and to form words into coherent sentences.

Usually when a person receives information from other people, either by reading
through the organs of sight, or by listening through the organs of hearing,
this information is already presented in the form of words, and if there arises
a need to voice this information or record it in words, there is no problem —
all previously remembered words and expressions are reproduced.  This comes
especially easily to people who have experience in public speaking and skills
in presenting different topics.

But when a person nonverbally receives new information directly in the form of
thoughts, i.e., through the formation of certain neural connections in the brain
and their weights, e.g., through
[intuition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition) as a result of
[insight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight), or
prophetic [inspiration](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inspiration)
(*ruach ha‑kodesh*), then there arises the necessity to formulate the received
information in the form of words, to articulate complete finished sentences and
to construct from fragments of thoughts a coherent text — it is precisely then
the problem appears.

Not only Moshe, but other prophets as well had this problem.
For example, it affected Yirmeyahu ([1:6](https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.1.6)).
At the time when he was an inexperienced youth, he attempted to refuse
becoming a prophet.  But G‑d helped him, suggesting what he needed to say,
placing thoughts directly into the mind.

The following concepts, employed in computational linguistics and representing
opposing processes, may help better understand the essence of the problem:

1. *[analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_analysis)* and
   *[recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition)*;
2. *[synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis)* and
   *[generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_generation)*.

In the human brain, the first of the aforementioned is engaged during learning,
when a person receives new knowledge and engages in its analysis.  But the
second of the aforementioned is based on entirely different algorithms,
when it is necessary to transmit accumulated knowledge to other people.
Therefore, entirely different skills are required.

This problem is exacerbated when a person is compelled to remain long
in solitude in continuous contemplation of the information received.
<!-- Rambam advised spending as much time as possible in solitude for communion with G‑d
(*Moreh Nevukhim* [3:51](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_Part_3.51.10)).
But seclusion is recommended only in moderation, because when one is cut off
from the world (as with the Haredim) moral development does not occur
(*Moreh Nevukhim* [3:54](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_Part_3.54.7)). -->
Therefore it is unsurprising that such a problem affected Moshe,
who spent much time in the wilderness without human companionship,
<!-- as David later lived in prolonged solitude in the wilderness and in the mountains
(Shmuel I [23:14](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.23.14)) and Eliyahu
(Melakhim I [19:4,8](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.19.4-8)) -->
when he received thoughts directly from G‑d not in verbal form,
but on a conceptual level.  As it is said in Bemidbar
[12:6-8](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.12.6-8),
G‑d revealed Himself to Moshe not in a vision and not in a dream,
as with other prophets, but on the level of
[mental images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_image).

Therefore after his return he needed Aharon, who knew how to express his
thoughts precisely and beautifully, to deliver speeches eloquently before the
people and Pharaoh, and possessed the gift of persuasion, fluent speech
and oratorical mastery.

Their interaction was structured approximately such that the thoughts
G‑d placed in Moshe's mind he would explain in his own language to Aharon,
<!-- who possessed a more substantial appearance and charisma
(skills of theatrical craft, artistry) --> what needed to be said —
approximately as a
[literal translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_translation)
appears before its literary refinement.

Contemporary examples of similar interaction include such roles as
[press secretary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_secretary) and
[spokesperson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokesperson), who directly
represent their employer, or
[speechwriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speechwriter), who writes speeches
that are then delivered by the client.  There also exists such
a concept as [ghostwriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwriter) — this
is when a prominent person, not possessing the art of eloquence, hires a writer
who, without disclosure of authorship, writes a book on their behalf.

<!-- BTW, the manifestation of *kvad-peh* in the text guarantees
that the text was not generated by artificial intelligence. -->

But I do not believe that Aharon composed the Torah under Moshe's dictation,
recording his thoughts, because the text of the Torah is written in such
a truthfully simple and universally comprehensible language, without a single
superfluous word, everything only to the point, as G‑d communicates with people,
that there is no doubt that the author of the Torah is Moshe himself,
who recorded the words of G‑d.
<!-- It appears that during forty years of daily communion with the people,
Moshe overcame his speech impediment and acquired the ability to clearly
express his thoughts.  Or G‑d placed ready words into Moshe's mind. -->

And it matters not what the
[documentary hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_hypothesis)
asserts on this account.
<!-- For example, I read Richard Friedman, but was not impressed —
this did not shake the foundations of my faith. -->
I believe with perfect faith that both sources: the Yahwist source (J)
and the Elohist source (E) derive from one original text recorded
by Moshe Rabbeinu, and also that the Priestly Code (P) and Deuteronomy (D)
contain laws given to Moshe Rabbeinu.

| And G‑d drove back the sea with a strong east wind all night, and turned the sea into dry land | וַיּ֣וֹלֶךְ יְהֹוָ֣ה ׀ אֶת־הַ֠יָּ֠ם בְּר֨וּחַ קָדִ֤ים עַזָּה֙ כׇּל־הַלַּ֔יְלָה וַיָּ֥שֶׂם אֶת־הַיָּ֖ם לֶחָרָבָ֑ה |
|| (Shemot [14:21](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.14.21)) |
{: .chapter #exodus title="Exodus"}

There exist many different interpretations of the story about crossing the
sea during the Exodus, different versions of events, various theories.  Most of
them presuppose a violation of physical laws, believing that only impressive
effects are capable of so shocking the imagination that readers will believe
in the reality of these events.  Such versions differ in their degree of
fantastical nature, and the most radical even reach the possibility of
draining the floor of the Gulf of Eilat to a depth of dozens of meters.
But for a modern person it is difficult to accept such a flagrant violation of
the laws of physics on faith.  Therefore there also exist theories which attempt
to explain the events of the Exodus within the framework of the laws of nature,
for example, representing the ebb of the sea as the withdrawal of water
from the shore before a tsunami caused by the eruption of the volcano
Santorini in the Mediterranean Sea, etc.

<!--
And the words that the wall is to the right and to the left are an allegory,
a periphrasis of the commandment not to turn aside either to the right
or to the left, with the simultaneity of gevurah (*ha‑yad ha‑gdola*)
and chesed (“You led the people in Your mercy”).

Therefore such vertical walls of water, as sometimes depicted, are impossible on
Earth due to the physical laws established by G‑d — G‑d does not violate His laws.
Theoretically this would be possible only on planets located near black holes —
as in the film *[Interstellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film))*.
-->

I have been fortunate that in order to find explanations for the stories
presented in the Torah — explanations that do not contradict the immutable laws
of the material world — I need not devise any theories, but need only delve
into my memories and extract from recollection all the signs and hints
related to these events that G‑d provided in life.

And indeed, I had such an incident that explains the events of the Exodus.

In childhood I lived in a place resembling the Sea of Reeds —
on the shore of a bay.  When the east wind blew, it
drove the water [away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_setup)
from the bay, and the water level dropped by 1–2 meters.

Once, a strong east wind blew all night, driving the water away from the bay,
and therefore by morning the water level had dropped by approximately one meter.
As a result, the bay became so shallow that it became possible to cross it on foot.

And so during this low tide, having gathered courage, we began moving across the
bottom of the receded sea.  We needed to traverse approximately half a kilometer
in total.  The sea was completely calm, and nothing foreshadowed any problems ahead.

At first it was easy to walk waist-deep in water, but soon the water began to
rise, and within a few minutes it reached up to the chin, so that by the middle
of the way we had to walk neck-deep in water.

But the most terrible trial awaited ahead.  Suddenly great waves arose
upon the sea, reaching a height of more than a meter.

This is because not far from this place in those years there was a Soviet
military base of atomic submarines.  <!-- I myself saw these atomic submarines up
close in the port of the city with the military base, when my grandfather took
me there.  There was a closed military city there, but grandfather supervised
the construction of the road to that city, therefore he had a pass to go there.
I remember how he told of having to dig out enormous boulders from the road.
If one were to draw analogies, this was similar to how the Jews in Egypt
were in service to Pharaoh. -->

Thus, one submarine at full speed sailed close to the sea's surface near the
shore, raising dangerous high waves with its hull.  To save ourselves, we began
jumping in rhythm with the waves: when a high swell approached, we pushed off
from the bottom so that our heads would remain on the surface of the wave's
crest.  After some time the submarine sailed away, the waves ceased, and we
safely came ashore, rejoicing in our deliverance.

Before this event, yet another incident occurred.  We built a raft and floated
down the river toward the sea.  Suddenly, at the estuary, Soviet border patrol
swooped down upon us and broke apart our raft before our very eyes.  Meanwhile,
their commander spoke absurd words to his soldiers: “Break it apart, search
for weapons and drugs!”  It was deeply offensive.  This was done to prevent
attempts to escape from the Soviet Union by sea, just as Pharaoh would not let
the Jews go.
<!-- And on the seashore stood border towers like in a concentration camp. -->

It's possible to draw numerous parallels between the Egyptian and Soviet empires — even
the gematria of the word *USSR* equals the gematria of the word *Mitzrayim* = 380.
For example, in Shemot [10:10-11](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.10.10-11)
Pharaoh refused to let the children go with their parents,
and in the Soviet Union they likewise demanded that children be left as hostages even
when parents traveled to neighboring socialist countries.  Therefore in childhood
I was deprived of the opportunity to visit these countries, and lost a great deal
because of this.

It is noteworthy that the aforementioned crossing of the sea occurred at
a place bearing signs that indicated its connection with the Egyptian desert.
On the shore stood two large boulder-stones: one stone in the shape of
a pyramid, as an allusion to the Egyptian pyramids, and another stone with
the outline of a camel, which recalled the desert.  These stones were called
accordingly: *Pyramid* and *Camel*.  Furthermore, at that place on the seashore
grows reed grass, alluding to the Sea of Reeds.

The literal translation of the name *[Yam Suph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yam_Suph)*
is Reed Sea, not Red Sea.  Interpreting all these clues, we can understand
where the crossing of the sea actually took place during the Exodus from Egypt.

Around Egypt there are few bodies of water in which reeds grow.  It is known
that reeds do not grow in the Red Sea.  Moreover, both in the Red Sea and in
the Gulf of Eilat there are such great depths that even if they could be drained,
there would be formed in their place substantial differences in elevation with
ravines and gorges, particularly impassable for women and children.
And certainly the Egyptians could not have even attempted to travel there with
chariots.  This means that the place of crossing must have had a level bottom.

<!--
Also in the Egyptian plagues the locusts were blown into *Yam Suph*
(Shemot [10:19](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.10.19)),
which implies a location on the eastern border of Egypt.
-->

The only place that fully corresponds to all the details
of the description is the strait between
[Great Bitter Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Bitter_Lake) and
[Small Bitter Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Bitter_Lake).
In it, reeds grow in salt water, which justifies the name.  Most importantly,
if we look at the depth chart, it is evident that in the strait between the
Bitter Lakes, at the deepest point, the depth varies between 2 and 3 meters.
To cross on foot at this place during high tide would have been impossible.

On the map it can be seen that the strait between the lakes runs from east to
west, therefore the wind blowing from the east drove the water from the Small
Bitter Lake into the Great Bitter Lake, lowering the water level in the strait
to such a level that during low tide one could walk across most of it on the
dried bottom, and it would not have been a problem to wade through short
sections even waist-deep in water.

<!--
At present, the eastern wind does not greatly lower the water level in those
lakes due to the excavated Suez Canal.  But tides and ebbs remain.  For example,
the case in 2021, when in the Suez Canal a container ship ran aground due to
wind and ebb tide.  Charts showed that the amplitude of tides and ebbs
approximately corresponds to human height, i.e., between 1.5 and 2 meters, and
this is only tides and ebbs, not the result of strong wind.  The amplitude of
water level fluctuation is within the range of human height, and three thousand
years ago, of course, there existed no canal in its present form, but there was
a shallow strait, no deeper than three meters, therefore through ebbs alone the
depth was significantly reduced, and thanks to the wind one could peacefully
cross on foot.
-->

Based on all this information, we can reconstruct the events of the Exodus
described in the Torah.  When the Pharaoh finally let the people go, G‑d did not
lead them directly to the land of the Philistines, but directed them on a detour
through the wilderness to the Reed Sea.  G‑d instructed Moshe that they must go
to the Reed Sea, as the only possible place of salvation.

And so, they then encamped in the region of Pi ha‑hiroth opposite the Sea of
Reeds.  On the map it can be seen that between the Great Bitter Lake and the
Small Bitter Lake there is situated a cape — a stretch of land projecting at
a sharp angle between the Bitter Lakes.  When bnei Yisrael encamped
upon this cape, Pharaoh gained confidence that they had fallen into a trap,
where on one side were high cliffs, and on the other an impassable sea.
<!-- This corresponds completely to the description in *Jewish Antiquities* II. -->

And then the strong east wind that had blown all night drove back the water
from the strait, and a passage was formed on the bottom, two kilometers long
and five kilometers wide, through which the people could cross from the western
shore to the eastern.

And when bnei Yisrael had passed through the strait, and the wind
ceased to blow, the water began gradually to rise, first hindering the
advance of the chariots, and then completely covering the Egyptian army.
<!-- The Egyptian army was punished by drowning because the Egyptians
had drowned Jewish infants — measure for measure. -->

None of the available cartographic services on the Internet shows the depths of
water bodies by means of lines connecting points of equal depth, which are
called *isobaths*.  The only maps where depths are marked are the so-called
“General Staff maps”.  Created in Soviet times, these maps covered almost the
entire world, including detailed maps of Israel and Egypt.  Apparently,
Soviet generals were preparing to wage war throughout the entire world.

So looking at the General Staff map number H‑36‑XV with the vicinity of
the Bitter Lakes, it can be seen that on one side of the Bitter Lakes
there are mountains and cliffs 200 meters high, while the depth in the strait
reaches 3 meters — precisely as much as is needed so that a strong wind could
cause a low tide, and the people could pass through on foot along the bottom,
while after the high tide a water mass above 2 meters destroys the Egyptian army.

<!--
![exodus map](../../../files/book/exodus_map.png){:.center}
-->

In ancient times, weather conditions were completely determined, since
people had no ability to influence the climate.  Therefore it was known
precisely many years in advance what weather would occur at a specific moment
in time in a specific place.  Thanks to the predictability of weather, it was
known to G‑d beforehand when a strong wind would blow in the region of the strait
between the lakes.  Therefore G‑d placed in Moshe's mind the thought that at the
known time in this place a strong wind would make the lake shallow, and thanks
to this there would appear the sole chance for salvation, if they would pass
through the strait precisely during the low tide.  When Moshe raised his staff,
he already had such certainty that the ebb would soon begin.

<!-- To more precisely match the crossing of the sea to the known time of the
wind, it was necessary to hold back the development of events somewhat.
It was necessary to delay the Egyptians in order to match exactly the time
of the wind.  G‑d knew when the wind would come, therefore it was necessary
to delay the Egyptians. -->

Later in Bemidbar [13-14](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.13-14) in precisely
the same manner all favorable conditions were created for the successful
conquest of the land of Canaan, and G‑d informed Moshe of this.  But the scouts
showed faintheartedness, and the people rebelled due to disbelief that it would
succeed as favorably as when G‑d chose the time for successful deliverance from
the Egyptians and informed Moshe of this possibility — that is, the chutzpah
of the scouts and the people was depleted.  <!-- In precisely the same way
in the twentieth century rabbis were fainthearted, resisting Zionism.  -->

G‑d creates thoughts at the quantum level in the human brain.
Sometimes directly, sometimes through angels, as it is said in Bemidbar
[20:16](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.20.16): “He sent His messenger and
brought us forth out of Egypt”.  And the words of Shemot
[23:21](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.23.21) “hearken to his voice” command us
to follow the thoughts placed by angels in the heads of the prophets.
<!-- see also *Moreh Nevukhim*
[2:34](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_Part_2.34) -->

<!-- At present, due to human influence, climate change is occurring,
therefore the climate is now non-deterministic and weather is unpredictable.
Because of this, in our days G‑d would not be able to help cross the *Yam Suph*,
since due to anthropogenic climate change it is impossible to predict in advance
when there will be wind in a given location.  -->

<!-- Also, due to the complete determinism of celestial body movement,
G‑d knows with certainty at what time the Earth's orbital path will intersect
with the orbit of a large comet or asteroid, collision with which could destroy
life on Earth.  Therefore humanity was given the possibility of space exploration,
so that it would be possible to send a spacecraft to such an object that would
deflect its trajectory away from Earth.  -->

<!-- Now people have taken upon themselves responsibility for their actions.
For example, people can punish themselves with a flood due to the melting of ice.
But even G‑d does not know the further history of humanity,
otherwise after spoilers it would be uninteresting to watch.
Because it is impossible to calculate in advance,
the development of history depends on the actions of each soul.
Therefore it is necessary to continuously recalculate anew.
Incidentally, in the modern world democracies are more predictable
than autocracies, because decisions are shaped by the overall
consensus rather than the evil inclinations of a single dictator. -->

The greatness of Moshe lay in that he led the people precisely when, through
intuition, he learned from G‑d that the water would recede due to wind and low tide.
Moshe did not resist the will of G‑d, <!-- as initially at the burning bush, -->
but followed his intuition and brought the people at the right time to the right place.
Therefore, Moshe's merit lies in that he correctly interpreted the signs and hints
from G‑d, and accordingly began to act decisively.

And the merit of the Jewish people lies in that they believed Moshe:

> and the people believed in G‑d and in Moshe, His servant
(Shemot [14:31](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.14.31))

They believed that Moshe was G‑d's messenger, and that he was charged with
saving the people.  And the people hearkened unto Moshe, and precisely at the
time of low tide they went forth from Egypt, and received the commandments
at Mount Sinai.

| When you build a new house, make a parapet for your roof, so that you bring not blood upon your house if anyone should fall from there. |
| (Devarim [22:8](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.22.8)) |
{: .chapter #personal title="Personal Commandments"}

For each relevant commandment, G‑d gave me examples in life, creating such
situations so that from each instance we could extract a lesson and understand
how the commandment should be fulfilled.

My grandfather fulfilled this commandment thus: our house in the forest
had a flat roof suitable for walking on, and pine needles gradually
accumulated on the roof.  Over the course of a year, a rather thick layer
of needles would build up, obstructing the water drainage, so periodically
it needed to be swept.  Each summer I would climb onto the roof by ladder
and clean it with a broom.

On the roof of our house there was no railing, since making a permanent parapet
was unrealistic.  Therefore each time I approached close to the edge of the
roof, especially when I was backing toward the edge so that the roof's edge was
not visible, my grandfather would warn me from the ladder about the danger, that
the edge was already near, so that I would be especially careful at the edge.
This was sufficient for observing the commandment, therefore my Jewish
grandfather could consider this commandment fully fulfilled.

In essence, this is a commandment concerning safety precautions, which obligates
us to take all possible measures of caution to prevent accidents.

In modern civilization this includes traffic regulations, regular vehicle
inspections, and detailed instructions for using household appliances with
warnings to keep plastic packaging away from children, and numerous other
such precautions.  All these moral norms concerning human safety have
their roots in the Torah.

| You shall not move your neighbor's boundary |
| (Devarim [19:14](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.19.14)) |
{: .chapter}

| Cursed be he who moves his neighbor's boundary |
| (Devarim [27:17](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.27.17)) |
{: .chapter}

For every relevant commandment G‑d gave me an occasion in life.  Once, when
no one had been home for a long time, the neighbors wanted to take advantage
of this moment and quietly move the fence between the properties.
But fortunately, their preparations were accidentally discovered,
so they managed to avoid the curse.  So that such a thing would not happen
again in the future, and to eliminate entirely the temptation to move the fence,
special landmarks as border markers were installed along the boundary.

And later this problem was resolved through detailed cartography, where
meticulous legal documentation reduced the opportunities for such cases.

<!--
In this case a computer solution is justified.  Problems arise when computer
solutions are used by totalitarian regimes.  But in the present case for
protecting personal property — ok.
-->

And just recently, an official email was sent, where in a digitally signed PDF
spanning several pages all the details were thoroughly laid out with maps, and
with the help of modern technologies the boundaries were established with
precision to the centimeter.  Quote from the letter: “The deviation in the
placement of the boundary marker compared to the 1997 measurements was 21
centimeters, which exceeded the permissible margin of error.”
Finally, justice has prevailed.

| If you encounter your enemy's ox or donkey going astray, you shall surely return it to him |
| (Shemot [23:4](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.23.4)) |
{: .chapter}

| If you see your brother's ox or his sheep going astray, do not pass them by, but return them to him.  If he is not near, or you do not know him, then bring the ox or sheep to your home, and let them remain with you until their owner comes for them. So shall you do also with his donkey, with his garment, and with any other lost thing — if you find it, do not remain indifferent — return it to him. |
| (Devarim [22:1-3](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.22.1-3)) |
{: .chapter}

For each relevant commandment, G‑d created corresponding situations in my life.
<!--
Cases related to the commandments kept happening to me constantly, despite the
fact that I try to sit quietly and not stick out, something is happening all the time.
-->

When I worked in the city center and spent nights in a residential district
on the outskirts, which was 20 kilometers from my workplace, I would leave work
late in the evening and reach home on foot after midnight, when public transport
no longer ran.  And so one time, deep in the night, I was walking along the city
boundary: to the right was an illuminated street of a residential area, and to
the left in the darkness was a village without a single light.  And suddenly
I saw by the road at the village boundary a flock of sheep standing there.
It must have been that the sheep had escaped from their owner through a breach
in the fence and went toward the light, until they came up against the
illuminated street, where they stopped.

I very much wanted to return the lost sheep to their owner, but could not think
of what might have been done in that situation:

1. I could not return the sheep, since I did not know to whom to return them,
therefore the option “you know him” was ruled out;
2. the option “bring the sheep to your home” would have meant bringing the entire flock
into my one-room apartment, and not on the first floor, meaning I would need
to go up in the elevator with the sheep, which was also absolutely unrealistic;
<!-- even despite the fact that the kitchen was so huge that it could accommodate all the sheep -->
3. “do not pass by” — although it is not explicitly written about this in the Torah,
perhaps it was necessary to call the militia.  But the problem was that I
could not call the militia, because the militia was engaged in extortion —
there were cases when the militia robbed instead of protecting.
Therefore it was impossible to expose oneself to danger.  But still in this case
the sheep could not get lost — in the morning the owners should have discovered
the flock by the road.

Therefore this case teaches that specific examples are not always applicable to
contemporary life, and we must follow the spirit of the Torah.  Though examples
were given of returning animals, in the literal sense this commandment is not
only about returning animals, but about any lost item, and it obligates us
to engage in returning all lost articles, in particular, through
[lost and found](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_and_found) offices
and by all other possible means.  All the time such cases occur when we must return
lost items, e.g., items found in transport must be given to the driver, etc.

| If you see the donkey of your enemy lying under its burden, do not abandon it: help to unload the donkey. |

In the modern world this commandment applies primarily to vehicles for helping
drivers when they are stuck or stopped due to breakdown.  For all the relevant
commandments I have had cases from personal experience.  For example, there were
cases when I helped pull vans out of snow with a tow rope, etc.  But generally
now in such cases it is sufficient simply to call the appropriate service,
which helps quickly resolve such problems.

| Do not withhold the wages of a day laborer until morning |
| (Vayikra [19:13](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.19.13)) |
{: .chapter}

| Do not oppress a hired worker, whether poor or needy, from among your brethren or from among the strangers.  Pay them in due time, on that very day give them their wages before the sun sets, for they are poor, and their soul depends upon it; lest they cry out against you to G‑d, and there be sin upon you. |
| (Devarim [24:14-15](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.24.14-15)) |
{: .chapter}

For each relevant commandment G‑d showed me examples in life.  When I was
studying in yeshiva, one incident occurred.  I was sitting and studying Torah,
including this very commandment, when suddenly I heard the yeshiva's cleaning
woman begin to request payment of the money she had earned, but they replied
that they could not pay her wages on the same day.  And she tearfully pleaded
to be paid for her work immediately, because she desperately needed the money
precisely on that day, but they promised to pay her only the following day.
And so they did not pay her, and she left the yeshiva deeply offended.

I sat with my back to them and throughout the entire dialogue never once
turned around, so as not to see which rabbi was so maliciously violating
the commandment of the Torah, because I do not wish to accuse anyone.
Satan accuses, but I don't accuse anyone, therefore I strove not to learn
who exactly was transgressing.  But the voice remained in my memory, and
later by the voice I recognized that it was the administrator of the yeshiva
— not a rabbi, and as far as I understood, not even a Jew, therefore formally
there was no violation by a Jew of the commandment not to delay payment of money
to a day laborer until the following morning.

It was simply dreadful to hear such a flagrant violation of the commandments
within the walls of the yeshiva.  Whether the nations of the world should learn
from the Jews, including the fulfillment of the commandment of timely payment —
this is a separate question.  The rabbis relied upon the administrator,
but he did not know the laws of the Torah, and thereby let down the Jews
by not transmitting the money from the Jews in time.  Therefore,
in the final account, the commandment was violated.
<!-- Or this was a violation of the commandment in
Devarim [17:15](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.17.15)
to appoint a leader only from among Jews —
in Kiddushin [76b](https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.76b.10) it is said that
this commandment applies not only to kings, but to any leadership position.
And indeed, any leader must know and observe the laws of Judaism. -->

This case showed that this commandment has not lost its relevance in the modern
world.  In fact, if there was no such agreement, then it is not obligatory
to pay wages daily.  But the commandment obligates the employer to pay wages
within the agreed timeframe that was established in the employment contract.

| If a person makes a vow to G‑d or swears an oath, binding himself to fulfill it, then he must not break his word — all that he has spoken he must fulfill. |
| (Bemidbar [30:3](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.30.3)) |
{: .chapter}

| If you make a vow to the L‑rd your G‑d, do not delay in fulfilling it … But if you refrain from making vows, there shall be no sin upon you. |
| (Devarim [23:22-24](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.23.22-24)) |
{: .chapter}

Before I reached the study of this commandment in yeshiva, out of noble motives
I promised to regularly give tzedakah to those in need.  But then circumstances
changed such that I myself was left without money.  The most terrible thing
was that those in need continued to expect help from me, while I was no longer
able to help them, and thereby caused additional hurt feelings.
Thus from my own experience I learned that we must strive not to make promises,
even when we wish to do a good deed.  We must do good deeds quietly,
without publicizing our own intentions.

This is very correctly written in the Kitzur Shulchan Arukh
[67:3](https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Arukh.67.3), that it is better to
refrain even from promising to give charity, and instead, as soon as the needed
sum becomes available, to give it immediately.  But when one nevertheless cannot
resist speaking aloud about one's good intentions, then if fulfillment of the
promise is not guaranteed, one must always add *bli neder*, which literally
means “without a vow”, “without a promise”, “without an obligation to fulfill”.

It is known that Sigmund Freud at the beginning of his career unsuccessfully
attempted to find a solution to the problem of sexual reproduction of
[eels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_eel).  As a young student, in 1876
Freud dissected hundreds of eels in attempts to find male sexual organs in them.
At the end of his fruitless efforts he was compelled to acknowledge his
[defeat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eel_life_history#Past_studies_of_eels) —
and out of frustration turned to psychoanalysis.

This riddle troubled people even in antiquity.  Aristotle devoted
considerable time to it — the ancient Greeks were certain that eels
[spontaneously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_generation)
arise from mud.  Jewish sages also believed in the possibility of animals
originating through non-sexual means in mold and even designated separate
commandments concerning insects born from mud (*Sefer HaMitzvot*
[177-179](https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot,_Negative_Commandments.177-179)).

And only toward the end of the twentieth century, with the emergence of new
possibilities for research, did it become known where eels mate and spawn.
It was discovered that the eel spawns on the floor of the Sargasso Sea at depths
of half a kilometer.  From there, over the course of several years, the larvae
traverse thousands of kilometers, drawn by the warm Gulf Stream current toward
the shores of Europe.  Having passed through several life cycles, the eels
return from European waters across the Atlantic Ocean back to their birthplace
for reproduction.

Therefore, remembering how wondrous these creatures are, it is repugnant to me
even to think about the possibility of consuming them as food.  This once again
demonstrates the humanity of kashrut, which forbids the consumption of seafood
and thus preserves the population of these amazing creatures.

It is possible that the prohibition on consuming pigs is connected
to their high intellectual capacities, which are close to those of humans.
And Rambam said in *Moreh Nevukhim*
[3:48](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_Part_3.48)
that pigs are beneficial neither for health nor for morality. -->

In my childhood I had one incident when after a meat meal there was nothing else
to drink except milk.  Usually I would drink tea or juice, but that time for
some reason there was only milk available.  And so I had to drink milk after

Once I had such an incident — at work it was a short pre-holiday day, so the
cafeteria was closing earlier than usual, and the selection of dishes was limited.
When I came there just before closing, only one dish remained on the menu —
with blood sausage.  I had no choice, since I absolutely needed to have lunch,
so I had to take it.  And there I sat, trying to convince myself that this was
normal food, edible, not poison.  But when I brought a piece to my mouth,
I nearly vomited.  And then I realized that there are boundaries —
what we may consume and what we may not.

I still remember, in childhood Soviet dumplings were sold with clots of blood.
Since there was nothing else to eat, I would carefully separate all the blood
clots and set them aside on the edge of the plate.  Thus my Jewish soul from
childhood already opposed non-kosher food.

{: .chapter #alien title="Orphan, Widow, Stranger"}

When I was 5 years old, as soon as I learned to read, I began studying Torah
on my own, and from the Torah I learned of the existence of G‑d.
<!-- But the Haredim at age 5 begin studying only Halakha.
And they reach the Torah only at 18 years old. -->

This was at the very height of the atheistic Soviet regime's repressions against
religion, when the study of Torah was forbidden.  After the Yom Kippur War,
Jewish consciousness increased behind the Iron Curtain, and correspondingly
the repressions against dissidents intensified by the Soviet authorities,
who prohibited the study of Torah.

At such a time I began to study Torah.  Having studied the first chapter of
Beresheet, I learned that there exists G‑d, who created our world
and gave each person life, and therefore for this we must thank G‑d.

And so one day on a sunny winter morning I went out to walk.  And it was so good
that I realized that we must thank G‑d for G‑d having given such a wondrous
life.  No one taught me, I myself recognized that I must do what was analogous
to the Shehecheyanu blessing, because this was done by many generations of my
Jewish ancestors, and the necessity of this remained in my Jewish genes.

Thus, from the age of five I established a direct connection with G‑d,
fulfilling the commandment to know G‑d, and subsequently this helped me greatly.

| Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the earth |
| (Shemot [20:12](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.12), Devarim [5:16](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.5.16)) |
{: .chapter}

When I went to school, lessons told of the horrors of concentration camps,
though in Soviet school they concealed the fact that most of the prisoners were Jews.
They told of how the Nazis flayed the skin from prisoners.  And at home
in practice, mother demonstrated the same thing: she would scratch off my skin
with her nails, tear hair from my head — such unbearable torture and beatings
continued every day.  I went to school with bruises and scars
on my body all the time, trying to hide the wounds.

This hell was for no reason — in my childhood I was an exemplary Jewish boy,
educated and intellectually developed, well-behaved, did not use profanity,
had a wide range of interests, tried to befriend everyone —
for example, in school everyone divided into rival factions,
but I was a peacemaker between them, as it is said in Tehillim
[34:15](https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.34.15): “Seek peace and pursue it”.

And after returning from school each day, a nightmare awaited me at home,
and I could do nothing to avoid it, because the triggers for beatings
were the most insignificant.  For example, slamming the refrigerator door
too loudly — mother would immediately attack me with a knife, threatening
to kill me, while I would kneel in supplication with folded hands
and with tears in my eyes, pleading: “Mommy, please don't kill me!”

When a Jewish child has a non-Jewish mother — this is a catastrophe.
The Torah teaches correctly that a Jewish child should have a Jewish mother.
A Jewish child is absolutely defenseless against aggression from the mother.
<!-- As the majority did not resist and submissively went to the firing squads
and into the gas chambers, so did I. -->
For example, Russian children can stand up for themselves and respond in kind:
they can be rude to their mother and even fight back.  But a decent and modest
Jewish boy is incapable of such behavior.  And I silently endured the torments
and did not violate the commandment of honoring one's parents — I did not fight
back, did not retaliate in kind, and never once uttered a curse against mother
(Devarim [27:16](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.27.16)).

Can one continue to observe the commandment of honoring one's parents
after such terrible abuse?  I assert that not only can one, but one must.

Despite all these horrors, I forgave my mother everything, and when later
she fell ill with an incurable disease and lay in the hospital, bidding
farewell to life, when the doctors had already measured out the precise number
of remaining weeks, I besought G‑d that G‑d would not punish my mother, but
would heal her.  And a miracle occurred: my mother recovered — to the amazement
of the doctors, and then continued to live at home, and I visited her, as is
proper according to the commandments of the Torah.

But when several years before this my father fell ill with the same disease,
instead of turning to G‑d with a request for help in recovery, I bought up
scientific books on medicine and biology, and during the several weeks while my
father was slowly dying, I strove to understand how to defeat cancer.
<!-- The problem is that the program breaks down, and cells begin to multiply uncontrollably. -->
But I did not manage to come up with anything in time.  Therefore, the
following conclusion follows from this: we must strive to utilize all
achievements of science, and in particular medicine, for
*[pikuach nefesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikuach_nefesh)*,
for the saving of human life, for healing — as it is said in
Shemot [21:19](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.21.19): “for cure”.
<!-- i.e., will pay for the treatment -->  But when science and medicine
are powerless, we must rely upon G‑d, as it is said in
Shemot [15:26](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.15.26) and
Divrei ha‑yamim II [16:12](https://www.sefaria.org/II_Chronicles.16.12).

| And you shall not oppress the stranger; for you know the soul of the stranger, seeing you were strangers in the land of Egypt. |

Due to harassment from my mother, life became so unbearable that in the end
I was compelled to flee from home.  I then went to live with my grandfather
and settled with him.
This was in the early 1990s, when Jewish life began to revive —
grandfather would go to the Jewish community <!-- we lived near the community,
and later a new synagogue was built there --> and bring home
Jewish literature from the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture and
the Committee for Cultural Integration of Jews, and I read these books
on Jewish history, religion and traditions with great interest.
I still remember these books: Herman Wouk *This is My G‑d*,
Hayim Halevy Donin *To Be a Jew*, books on Jewish holidays,
the history and geography of Israel, and other books in the *Orot* series.
Every holiday, Jewish friends would come to grandfather, and I would eat
together with them traditional Jewish dishes, including *gefilte fish*, etc.

From childhood I felt myself to be a Jew.  Therefore when in the early 1990s
people were invited to a Jewish youth camp, I asked to be taken as well,
but the Orthodoxes refused with the explanation that Jewishness is determined
by the mother.  This was a shock for me.  I did not understand why, despite the
fact that in childhood I was no different from my Jewish friends, suddenly some
were declared Jews while others were cast out as outcasts.  I did not understand
the reason for such unjust segregation.

And then all my friends repatriated to Israel, while I remained alone and withdrew
into myself, for I thought the problem lay within me.  It was impossible to
build a life with an uncertain self-identification.  I did not understand why
the Orthodoxes rejected me, what my transgression was, if I felt myself to be
a Jew, yet they made it clear to me that I was an outcast.
Soon after this, grandfather died, <!-- 10/(23).03.1914 – 24.08.1995 ז״ל -->
and I lost the last thread connecting me to Judaism, therefore I began
to live in complete seclusion, and spent several years in solitude.

This continued until 2001, when terrorist attacks began in Israel.  What shocked
me the most was the terrible terrorist attack at the discotheque in Tel Aviv on
[1 June 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphinarium_discotheque_bombing),
where young people were killed — approximately the same age as my friends were
when they repatriated to Israel.  There is no more grave injustice than when
happy youth are deprived of life.  Therefore, identifying myself with the victims
of the terrorist attack, I became a Zionist, that is, a patriot of Israel.

Now many recalled their Jewish roots after the atrocious terrorist attack
on October 7, 2023.  For me such a turning point was June 1, 2001.

After this I traveled to Israel — and immediately fell in love with this
remarkable country.  I visited all the major cities, touring the landmarks
that preserve millennia of history.

<!--
For example, I found a more authentic cave of the prophet Eliyahu,
which appeared like a homeless person's dwelling, while the prophet
himself stood beside the cave.
-->

In Jerusalem I went each day to
*[HaKotel HaMa'aravi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Wall)*
(the Western Wall, the Wailing Wall), <!-- and listened to the sound of shofar -->
trying to understand what could be done so that it might become possible
to establish peace and build the Third Temple.

<!--
To experience firsthand the consequences of the Arab-Israeli conflict and find
ways to resolve it, I summoned the courage to try walking through an Arab
neighborhood in East Jerusalem dressed as a Jew and wearing a kippah.
Arab boys immediately noticed me, but instead of throwing stones at me,
they began loudly shouting “Shalom!” to me.  This gave hope for establishing
peace with the Arabs.
-->

I so loved the Jewish way of life in Israel that I wished to remain there
to live, observing all the laws and traditions of Judaism.  So in Jerusalem
I approached Orthodox rabbis who deal with the problems of repatriates.
They said that they did not consider me a Jew, because Jewishness is not
transmitted through the paternal line, and that I needed to undergo giyur.
Then I asked them to conduct giyur, but they replied that to do this for me
in Israel was absolutely impossible.  After this they began to dissuade me from
relocating to Israel, did not advise me to make use of the Law of Return,
they let me know that I had nothing to do in Israel, that Israel had no need of
me, in the sense that I was for them a persona non-grata.  I did not understand
why they considered that I as a Zionist was not needed in Israel, while all
around a hostile Arab environment was growing.  I did not understand why Israel
had no need of my working hands and mind, notwithstanding that I had a highly
demanded specialty in high-tech.  I did not understand why I should leave
Israel despite the fact that at that time I fully supported the Orthodoxes
in everything.

I was a permanent reader of websites with answers from Orthodox rabbis to the
most diverse questions, often provocative ones. <!-- *she'elot u‑teshuvot* -->
I very much enjoyed reading the rabbis' responses, and I agreed with their
opinion in everything.  All their halakhic responsa evoked genuine admiration
in me — I was amazed by the depth and wisdom of the Orthodox rabbis' answers.
And when I saw articles on other sites criticizing the Orthodoxes, such attacks
against the Orthodoxes angered me.  For example, when the Haredim protested
the compulsory showing films they disliked on airplanes, and news portals
criticized them for this, this greatly angered me — if people don't want to
watch films, then why force them upon them?  <!-- And now the civilized way
of resolving such conflicts are individual screens on the backs of seats. -->
I have personally found myself in such situations, when during lengthy bus
journeys I endured the forced screening of videos with the silliest films.
<!-- Of those films, only one was enjoyable — about the shlimazel —
*[Meet the Parents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_the_Parents)*. -->
<!-- And only when the journeys became routine was I able to sleep, paying no
heed to the loud films — for example, once they showed a film about airplanes,
but I slept so soundly that when in one episode there was a particularly loud roar
of a jet aircraft, I awoke for a few seconds and immediately fell asleep again. -->
Therefore I sympathized with the Orthodoxes and was always on their side
in all disputed matters.

During the trip to Israel I had little luggage, so every gram counted, but I could
not resist purchasing one book that astounded me and became a treasured volume.
When I was leafing through various books in the bookstore, I found one
that was impossible to put down.  This book described Rabbi Nachman's
journey to the Land of Israel.  I remember being deeply impressed
by one episode: in Tiberias at a great feast all the renowned rabbis of the
Land of Israel gathered, and during the conversations it became necessary to
find where in the Talmud one of Rashi's commentaries was located.  This was
needed to resolve a disputed question, but no one could remember, though
those present were great scholars of the Talmud.  Out of modesty Rabbi Nachman
remained silent at first, but when he saw that no one was able to recall it,
he named the precise location of this commentary of Rashi: tractate
[Zevachim](https://www.sefaria.org/Zevachim), page number and place
on the page.  They began to check, and indeed, that's where it was.

<!-- I have a similar story.  At the beginning of the school year, after
receiving my textbooks, I would immediately read through them all.  And so
it happened that once during mathematics class, the teacher asked the class
about a theorem that we had not yet covered.  But I was too shy to raise my hand,
ashamed to display my knowledge.  And there we all sat in silence, no one
answering.  Then the teacher was horrified and exclaimed in shock: “How is it
possible that no one in the entire class knows?!”  Only after this, to save the
honor of the class, did I stand up and clearly expound the content of this
theorem.  This incident also shows that I only do what no one else does. -->

But despite my complete goodwill toward the Orthodoxes, instead of supporting and
blessing me in my aliyah, the Orthodoxes accused me of simply trying to penetrate
a successful country for mercenary purposes, while I was a citizen of a no less
successful country of the European Union, a holder of a highly demanded
profession, and moreover had accumulated considerable wealth, allowing me
to live comfortably for quite a long time without income.

Nevertheless, when the Orthodoxes finally pushed me out of Israel with contempt,
I was not offended.  I thought that the problem was with me, that I was somehow
“wrong”, “deficient”, and that I myself was to blame for this, and that I needed
to somehow correct myself.

And then I departed to live in London, as sung in the well-known song
by Chava Alberstein *London lo mekhaka li* (London does not await me).

I hoped that there, at least, everything would work out.  It seemed to me
the most preferable option since it was one of the countries where
I could live freely without a visa.

In London I settled in the Jewish district of Golders Green, and began attending
synagogues every Shabbat <!-- BTW, the Internet was disconnected there
on Sabbaths, which is unsurprising --> and on holidays — there are so many
synagogues in this district that if one walks down the street, from the outside
it appears that ordinary houses line the street, but if one approaches closer,
it becomes noticeable that almost every house has a synagogue open within it.
<!-- This is evident from the signs reading *nashim-anashim*. -->  Thus, I would
first attend Sabbath prayers, and then go to kiddushim at all the synagogues in
the vicinity — convenient, when dozens of synagogues are located within walking
distance.  In many other countries there is no such luxury — the difference is
especially felt in countries where there is only one synagogue for the entire
country.

<!--
Photo of the synagogue to which I went every Sabbath in London:

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S727AvKfP-Y">
<img src="../../../files/book/krugom_odni.jpg" class="center">
</a>
-->

Besides observing Shabbat, I also ate kosher food thanks to the fact that there
were many kosher stores near my home — I constantly ate kosher dishes of Jewish
cuisine: chicken broth, kugel, cholent and challah on Sabbaths, drank chalav
Yisrael.  On the front door hung a mezuzah with the Tower of David
(*Migdal David*) and the letter **ש** etc.

Every week I went to study Hebrew in
[London Jewish Cultural Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Jewish_Cultural_Centre),
which was not far from my house, so it was convenient to walk there.
The Jewish center LJCC was located in Ivy House, where the famous ballerina
Anna Pavlova had previously lived.  Such a fitting place for a Jewish center
was chosen because of her Jewish origins.

I have a personal story connected to this place: as a child I was captivated by
the film shot in this house.  The film about Anna Pavlova showed her London house
and the pond with swans, and I fell so in love with this that I dreamed of
visiting her house.  But in Soviet times this was an unattainable dream.
It is impossible to imagine greater surprise than I would have had if someone
had told me in 1983 that I would not only visit this house, but would go there
every week to study Hebrew.  Each time I came there, I could not believe that
dreams come true, that I was walking through the same rooms where Anna Pavlova
had lived, looking from the balcony at her beloved pond where swans swam.
And precisely during the time when I was there, a new statue was unveiled
in her former home.

<!--
![Anna Pavlova](../../../files/book/anna_pavlova.jpg){:.center}
-->

Also at that time I observed all the Jewish holidays, while not observing the
non-Jewish ones.  Many emigrants from post-Soviet countries still cannot rid
themselves of the idolatrous custom of celebrating Novigod with the sacrifice of
a spruce tree.  Celebrating the New Year is common in many countries
even among Orthodoxes.  Once on a New Year's Sabbath I arrived precisely
at the time for the beginning of prayer at an Orthodox synagogue, and observed
such a scene that the majority had overslept, and for a long time stragglers
gradually arrived, sleepy and sleep-deprived after New Year's night.  But
I don't blame anyone.  The only thing I wanted to note is that in this matter
I am more devoted to Judaism, since for decades already I have not followed this
ritual. <!-- since *avodah zarah* -->  But I observed all the Jewish holidays —
not Novigod, but our Jewish Rosh HaShanah.
<!-- And instead of “Na zdorovie” → “Lehaim!” -->

Once during Hanukkah, I even experienced a Hanukkah miracle.  Before Hanukkah
I was returning home from Hebrew lessons late in the evening, everything around
was already closed, and I remained without Hanukkah candles.  I walked sadly
along the main street of the Jewish neighborhood, Hanukkah lights burned
brightly in the windows, only I alone had no hanukkiah.

And so, when I was already approaching home hopelessly with empty hands,
on the street a little boy in a black suit suddenly approached me,
and extending a small box, asked:

“Do you want Hanukkiah?”

This was precisely what I had been lacking, therefore I joyfully replied:

“Yes, I need Hanukkiah!” and then added with despair: “But I have no candles” :-(

Then the boy exclaimed with consolation:

“There are candles inside!”

“Thank you very much!” :-)

<!--
This case shows an example of how Orthodoxes should proactively make the world
a better place.  A little boy in a hopeless situation came to help, because
he strove to manifest the qualities of mercy — chesed, but when Orthodoxes
grow up, their hearts become hardened, and they close themselves within
the vessel of the category of gevurah.
-->

The boy approached me because I looked like an Orthodox Jew.
There was another incident when in a supermarket a Jewish boy mistook me
for his Orthodox father, because I resembled Orthodox Jews.

Then on other days I would go to watch how in the center of the
Chabad district they would light the enormous Hanukkiah.

So for a long time I led a Jewish life.  But time passed, and
the Orthodox rabbis did not deem my efforts worthy of attention.
I do not know why they ignored me, and only with contempt silently gazed
upon my struggles.  Perhaps they did not take my aspirations seriously.
I never understood the reason for such cold treatment.

Despite the fact that I had settled in so well and established my daily life,
it was very painful to destroy everything.  But it all ended when I came
to the synagogue for the Passover Seder: the Orthodox rabbis said that
since I was a non-Jew, I must leave.  This was said publicly before
everyone, as in the story of Bar-Kamtza, who was driven out in shame.

<!-- Generally in the Torah it is said that the non-observant and uncircumcised
are forbidden to eat of the Passover sacrifice.  Nevertheless all secular Jews
participate in Passover seders.  And they are not cut off from their people,
as it is said in Beresheet [17:14](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.17.14),
but even on the contrary, e.g., they are accepted in a minyan, etc. -->

I was so ashamed and distressed that after this I retreated far from
everyone, and spent several years in solitude.  I realized that I had reached
a dead end, I was too drained even to go to work.  And by that time all my
saved money had run out — on all these useless trips because of the Orthodoxes
I had wasted about 40 thousand euros (mainly on hotels and long-term housing rental).
And so without work and without money I spent all my time sitting in a tiny
kitchenette measuring 2*2 meters: by one wall there was a sink and stove,
by the other wall a table with a chair, and right in the middle of the kitchen
on the floor a folding bed.
<!-- And it was impossible to go into the room, because to save on expenses
I had to turn off the heating in the room, and it was always very cold there. -->

I do not know how many more years I would have spent in such a hopeless
situation, but finally G‑d decided to interrupt my confinement and gave me
a sign to begin acting decisively so that I would have no other choice —
unexpectedly G‑d “rewarded” me with phimosis, so that I would urgently need
to undergo circumcision, and it would become impossible to refuse this.

<!--
Once in winter there were severe frosts, but the shower gel had run out at home,
and it was necessary to go to the store where I always bought one particular gel
that never caused any problems.  I had no cash, and very little money remained
in my account.  Therefore it was necessary to withdraw the remaining money from
an ATM.  And so in one shopping center I wanted to insert my bank card into the
ATM, but I was alarmed that some device resembling a skimmer was attached to the
card reader slot.  Later I learned that banks had begun installing
[anti-skimmers](https://www.google.com/search?q=antiskimmerid) on ATMs, i.e.,
devices that prevent the installation of skimmers by malefactors.  But I did not
know this then, so out of caution I had to go to another shopping center where
they sold the same gel.  And when I finally reached it and inserted my card into
the ATM, it turned out that this ATM was out of cash.  Nothing remained but to
go to a third ATM, which was near a small store.  After withdrawing the money,
there was no strength left to walk back through the frost to the shopping
center, so I had to seek a substitute for the gel in the small shop.  But there
was nothing better to be found than some kind of cleansing milk, which I had to
buy.  From all this wandering in the frost, the foreskin cracked, and after
washing with the milk it scarred over with thick scars and grew together so that
a wide dense growth formed, which caused an initial stage of cicatricial phimosis.
-->

This gave me the stimulus to begin acting more decisively and persistently.
I immediately turned without delay to Orthodox rabbis, and finally succeeded
in beginning the official process of conversion.

I did everything the Orthodox rabbis required.  When they said that on
the Sabbath I must walk to the synagogue on foot, I immediately rented
an apartment near the synagogue — for a great deal of money.  This was a great
sacrifice — renting an expensive apartment in the city center was an enormous
burden for me, I had to work more to be able to pay for this requirement, and
for a lengthy period of time, when I went to the synagogue every Shabbat.

I also fulfilled other requirements — periodically coming to the rabbis,
and they would tell me what to do next, what to read, which prayers and
blessings to learn, etc.

Over the course of 3 years I have several times carefully reread the
Kitzur Shulchan Arukh in different versions: without commentaries,
and with the commentaries of *Mishnah Berurah*, and with Hasidic insertions.
I have also read a large quantity of halakhic literature, and even delved
into the details of the multi-volume *Peninei Halakha*, and studied
several halakhot per day.

After several years of thorough preparation and study of Halakhah I was fully
prepared, and when I was confident that now I would certainly be accepted,
having accumulated enough money in savings, I quit my job so that nothing
would interfere with the completion of the process.

I was already observing everything the rabbis required.  The only thing I could
not do was cook chicken from the chicken meat that was distributed in the
synagogue.  The rabbis said I needed to take the raw meat from
the synagogue home, and at home I myself was supposed to cook and
prepare various dishes from the meat.  But I could not do anything with the meat
— when I took a piece of raw meat in my hands, I would begin to imagine what the
sacrifices looked like, when they slaughtered animals, flayed their carcasses,
and rivers of blood flowed, and from the terrible picture that appeared
in my imagination I began to feel sick.
<!-- This indicates that sacrifices should not be restored. -->

Then the rabbis advised me to get myself a girlfriend, so that she might prepare
for me various kosher dishes from chicken meat.  I did not understand this counsel.
For extramarital relations violate the commandments of the Torah,
<!-- “thou shalt not commit adultery” -->
not to mention the laws of modesty *tzniut* and the prohibition of seclusion *yichud*.
And since they did not consider me a Jew, how could they advise marrying a Jewish woman?
For in the *Laws of Forbidden Intercourse*
[13](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Forbidden_Intercourse.13)
it is clearly stated that before conversion they carefully examine whether the
gentile requests to be accepted among the Jews because he has set his eye upon
a Jewish woman.  And a gentile woman is examined whether she has set her eye
upon a Jewish man.  And in the Shulchan Arukh
Yoreh De'ah [268](https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.268.12)
all the same is stated.
Or perhaps they meant that I should marry a gentile woman?
But in any case, this makes no difference, since I could not marry anyway
due to phimosis, which by that time was already progressing to the final stage.

Then I told the rabbis that immediately after giyur and before marriage I could
order kosher dishes from the synagogue kitchen.  All the more so, since until
the completion of giyur it is forbidden to observe all the laws anyway.  And
the only law which I could not observe — I bought ready-made boiled chicken meat
without blood, but lacking certification from kashrut supervision authorities.

<!-- And in the *Sefer Chasidim* [690](https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Chasidim.690)
it is stated that one undergoing giyur must be fed kosher food. -->

Then the rabbis said that I must travel to another country, to train there in
a yeshiva to eat in a dining hall with completely kosher food.  Therefore
I obediently packed and immediately relocated, and began studying in the
yeshiva, and every day ate in the dining hall.  The only thing I did not
understand was how eating in the dining hall could help organize kosher eating
at home after completing the conversion.

Then I asked the rabbis how much more time I needed to spend in the yeshiva to
complete the conversion process.  They smirked and answered that it would take
at least another 15 years.  <!-- And they also explained their refusal to
accept me by citing one case where a convert completely abandoned Judaism. -->
This sounded like mockery, but I was not offended and continued spending entire
days in the yeshiva reading various halakhic literature, eating daily in the
yeshiva dining hall.

The quality of food in the dining hall was most abhorrent, the food was very
tasteless and unnutritious. <!-- low-calorie -->  I had long grown accustomed
to home-style food, and in the dining hall the food was exactly the same as it
once was in a Soviet student dining hall, when I had the feeling that dirty rags
had been rinsed in the pots of soup.  Tasty dishes were only for the meals on
Shabbat, but on other days I had to endure.

But the biggest problem was that the state of my health continued to
deteriorate sharply.  The terminal stage of cicatricial phimosis caused
inflammations that began to affect my internal organs, causing elevated
blood pressure.  Circumcision was urgently required.

I do not know how much more time I would have had to spend there.
Probably I would have perished there, ruining my health.

Then suddenly after some time my money unexpectedly ran out.  And there was no
money left to pay for the apartment, for whose rent I had continued paying in
order to hold it until my return, because I planned after completing the
process to return to that apartment where everything was prepared for leading
an Orthodox way of life.  But when the money ran out, there was nothing left
with which to pay the apartment rent.

<!-- Later I thought that perhaps the Orthodoxes were expecting bribes from me?
I was told rates with enormous sums that rabbis demand.
But by that time I had already run out of money,
so there remained no possibility to pay.
And most important remained the moral aspect of such a deed.
For it is said in Yeshayahu [1:23](https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.1.23):
“they all love bribes and chase after rewards; they do not judge
the orphan justly, and the widow's case does not come before them”. -->

It so happened that the paid rental period for the apartments ended precisely
on the day of the 17th of Tammuz.  This was a sign from G‑d that the Orthodoxes
were obligated to perform my circumcision before the 17th of Tammuz, when the
destruction of the Temple began.
<!-- Moreover, my birthday is on the 17th of Tammuz, i.e., exactly 1900 years later. -->
<!-- But Mashiach will be born on the 9th of Av. -->
And so came the day of the 17th of Tammuz, and I wept as I parted
from my beloved little apartment, from whose windows opened a beautiful
view of the synagogue.

Life was ending before it had begun, and I was alone once again, huddled in
a distant corner, without work and without money, accumulating enormous debt,
and with sharply deteriorating health.  Due to constant inflammation and
bleeding wounds, bloody hematomas began to appear,
[balanitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanitis) set in, because it was
impossible to wash, and then progressive damage to internal organs followed —
after touching the festering inflammation, burning pain would resonate in the
abdomen.

<!-- In my medical record, in the medical history, the physicians who examined
me recorded such a diagnosis that the primary condition was balanitis
(inflammation of the glans and foreskin), which caused accompanying
complications in the internal organs. -->

And so in this terrible state, in a hopeless situation, I began seeking in the
Torah answers to the questions of how such a thing could have happened, that
despite the fact that I tried very hard to do everything that the Orthodoxes
required, instead of performing a good deed and saving me by doing circumcision,
they so cruelly punished me, undermined my health, destroyed my life and
brought me to unbearable suffering.

<!-- During each attack, writhing in pain and sobbing, repeated:
“Why are the Orthodoxes such atheists?!  Why are the Orthodoxes such atheists?!” -->

First and foremost I began studying the commandment not to afflict
the orphan, the widow and the stranger.

| He provides justice for the orphan and the widow, and loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing.  And you shall love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. | עֹשֶׂ֛ה מִשְׁפַּ֥ט יָת֖וֹם וְאַלְמָנָ֑ה וְאֹהֵ֣ב גֵּ֔ר לָ֥תֶת ל֖וֹ לֶ֥חֶם וְשִׂמְלָֽה׃ וַאֲהַבְתֶּ֖ם אֶת־הַגֵּ֑ר כִּֽי־גֵרִ֥ים הֱיִיתֶ֖ם בְּאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם |
|| (Devarim [10:18-19](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.10.18-19)) |
{: .chapter}

| And a stranger you shall not oppress nor afflict, for strangers were you in the land of Egypt.  No widow or orphan shall you afflict.  If you cause him suffering, and he cries out to Me, I shall surely hear his cry. | וְגֵ֥ר לֹא־תוֹנֶ֖ה וְלֹ֣א תִלְחָצֶ֑נּוּ כִּֽי־גֵרִ֥ים הֱיִיתֶ֖ם בְּאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃ כאכׇּל־אַלְמָנָ֥ה וְיָת֖וֹם לֹ֥א תְעַנּֽוּן׃ כבאִם־עַנֵּ֥ה תְעַנֶּ֖ה אֹת֑וֹ כִּ֣י אִם־צָעֹ֤ק יִצְעַק֙ אֵלַ֔י שָׁמֹ֥עַ אֶשְׁמַ֖ע צַעֲקָתֽוֹ |
|| (Shemot [22:20-22](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.22.20-22)) |
{: .chapter}

The Torah repeatedly emphasizes the necessity of merciful treatment toward the
orphan, the widow and the stranger, because they belong to the category of the
most vulnerable people, easily hurt and defenseless, who bear hardships more
heavily than others.

And indeed, I may be called an orphan, because I lived as an orphan.  An orphan
is a person who has no possibility of turning to his mother to share personal
problems, to seek counsel, to receive support and comfort.  Instead of maternal
tenderness, instead of embracing me or patting me on the head, my mother
touched me only to strike, to tear the skin, or to pull out my hair.
Therefore I may be considered an orphan, for even with a living mother
I lived as one without a mother.

Also I can be considered a widow, because I lived exactly as a widow lives.
A widow is a person who has lost their beloved, their life companion, and
therefore lives in solitude, without family, and has no one close to share
their problems and feelings with.  My condition was even worse than
that of a widow.  A widow loses a close person once, but I lost a beloved
person dozens of times, and died after each parting forever.

As an angel is directly connected to G‑d, the soul of my beloved was like an
angel drawn near to G‑d.  When I gazed into her deep eyes, as an angel from G‑d
on one side looks through the eyes, looking from the other side, I could draw
near to G‑d.

<!-- Love is the highest manifestation of the soul's immortality. -->

The greatest love is given towards the simple-hearted person, when I loved
in my girl only the soul.  Through her soul connected to our world through
the eyes I entered that place outside from our world, where souls are
with G‑d, and felt all the power of immortal love, which comes from G‑d.
Thus love is the highest manifestation of the soul's immortality.

My soul ascended through her soul to G‑d, and my soul was filled with boundless
joy.  This same state of boundless joy awaits a person after the end of earthly
life, when the soul again returns to G‑d.

Therefore I could not help but await each new meeting, to draw near to G‑d once
more.  And each time the parting was for me precisely the same terrible loss as
was the expulsion of the first human beings from the Garden of Eden.  Each time
I felt upon myself all the horror of that state in which Adam and Chavah found
themselves after the expulsion from Paradise.  Each meeting was like the
life of Adam and Chavah with G‑d in Gan Eden, and after each parting
I felt upon myself that nightmarish state after the expulsion —
the sharp transition from infinite bliss into the perishable world,
full of suffering.

The first third of my life I lived as an orphan — until the age of 17.  At 17
I fell in love with the girl, and after that for the second third of my life
I lived also as a widow.  <!-- Therefore it is evident that true love lives
at least 33 years, but never dies.  -->
And throughout the entire third part of my life I also lived as a stranger,
unsuccessfully attempting to gain favor from the Orthodoxes.
For the aforementioned reason I strove to draw closer to the Orthodoxes as well,
mistakenly supposing that the Orthodoxes had a direct connection with G‑d.

And so in such a state — as an orphan, a widow, a stranger — I came to the
Orthodoxes, and they caused great offense.  No one had ever caused offense,
only the Orthodoxes offended.
<!-- Despite the fact that Rambam taught in Hilkhot Deot
[6:10](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Human_Dispositions.6.10)
that one must take care not to wrong such people as orphans and widows,
for they are defenseless and downtrodden, even if they are wealthy. -->
Moreover, I was not offended on my own behalf — I understand the imperfection of
the human being with all weaknesses and shortcomings, vices and sins, and that
people are still in the process of development.

But I took offense on behalf of G‑d — those Orthodox rabbis, whose task it is to
serve G‑d, instead completely ignored the commandments of G‑d, and made the world
a worse place.  Not for nothing is it said in the Mishnah Sanhedrin
[4:5](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.4.5):
“Whoever saves a single life, saves an entire world.”

1. The world collapsed each time my mother beat me, and I bade farewell to life.
2. The world collapsed each time I parted forever with the beloved girl.
3. The world collapsed each time the Orthodoxes cast me out, and in the end
   I suffered greatly because the Orthodoxes finally rejected me, refusing to
   perform circumcision.

I did everything possible to win favor from those I loved:

1. I strove to do everything correctly, studied well, distinguished myself by
   exemplary conduct — yet in return I received from my mother daily torments
   and beatings, and I sought to understand what must be done to repair this
   broken world.
2. I strove to do only pleasant things for the girl, yet still she was compelled
   to reject me, and I through suffering sought to understand the causes of
   unrequited love.
3. I strove to fulfill all that the Orthodoxes required, yet still I received
   rejection, and I during years of torment sought to understand the reasons
   why the Orthodoxes rejected me, and what must be done to remedy this.

Just as I feared to say an extra word to my mother, lest I give her additional
cause to beat me, so too I feared to say an unsuitable word to a girl, lest she
take offense and leave, and in precisely the same way I constantly feared that
the Orthodoxes might drive me away — all of them were unpredictable.

The more I loved, the more my beloved ones inflicted upon me not only spiritual
sufferings, condemning me to solitude, but also physical pain bearing the threat
of death:

1. In response to my love there was cruelty from my mother —
   she beat me constantly and threatened to kill me.
2. From unrequited love for a girl my heart ached intensely all the time.
<!-- And upon meeting, the heart ceased to ache —
I could feel how actively it was healing. -->
3. I besought the Orthodoxes to perform circumcision upon me, for an
   uncircumcised phimosis and balanoposthitis had brought physical suffering
   for many years, yet instead of relieving me of the ailment, the Orthodoxes
   did not deliver me from the disease but only continually humiliated me,
   drove me away, turned the stranger into a fugitive, thereby inflicting
   terrible sufferings.

Was always struggling for survival:

1. First, so that my mother would not kill me with beatings.
2. Then, so as not to die from the consequences of unhappy love.
3. Then, so that the Orthodoxes would not kill me by refusing to perform circumcision.

Because of my mother's cruelty, when there was no one to share my troubles with,
I felt like an orphan, even worse.  Then I lost my beloved — like a widow,
even worse.  In the end I asked the Orthodoxes to accept me — and was like
a stranger.

1. A mother's mercilessness wanted to kill me, but I survived.
2. Unrequited love wanted to kill me, but I survived.
3. The godlessness of the Orthodoxes wanted to kill me, but I survived.

Thus I suffered all my life — first from my mother, then from the girl, and
finally from the Orthodoxes, that is, from the people I loved, with whom I could
have been happy, but who rejected me.  There is nothing more terrible than
when the people you love reject you.

1. The first third of my life suffered from unrequited love for my mother —
   like an orphan.
2. The second third of my life suffered from unrequited love for my beloved girl —
   like a widow.
3. The third part of my life suffered from unrequited love for the Orthodoxes —
   like a stranger.

Despite the great importance the Torah places on the commandment not to
oppress or afflict the orphan, the widow and the stranger, because they
have no one to help them, the Orthodoxes completely ignore this commandment,
and have left the orphan, the widow and the stranger in torment.
<!-- merely because he dared to strive to do what G‑d requires -->

The Orthodoxes acted precisely as the prophets predicted:

> the stranger, the orphan, and the widow — oppress them not,
neither rob them, and innocent blood shed not in this place
(Yirmeyahu [22:3](https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.22.3))

> Woe unto the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of My pasture
(Yirmeyahu [23:1](https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.23.1))

> you have scattered My sheep and driven them away, and have not attended to them
(Yirmeyahu [23:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.23.2))

> The stranger suffered oppression in your midst,
the orphan and the widow have been wronged within you
(Yechezkel [22:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.22.7))

> You have not strengthened the weak, nor have you healed the sick,
nor have you bandaged the injured, nor have you brought back
the scattered, nor have you looked for the lost
(Yechezkel [34:4](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.34.4))

> Because you push with flank and shoulder, and gore all
the weak with your horns, until you drive them away
(Yechezkel [34:21](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.34.21))

<!--
> They slay the widow and the stranger and murder the orphan
(Tehillim [94:6](https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.94.6)) -->

And so in such a terrible state, in solitude, spurned by the Orthodoxes,
without money and without work, suffering from deteriorating health
due to the refusal of the Orthodoxes to perform circumcision upon me,
I began to study Torah intensively, to understand the reasons for such
flagrant heartlessness of the Orthodoxes, which in Pirkei Avot
[2:9](https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.9) is called by the
words *lev ra*, 'an evil heart'.
{: #convert title="Ruth"}

For this I've read everything possible and began by studying the history
of the conversion of idolaters to Judaism, which received the name *giyur*.
And here is what I discovered.

In earlier times, all who wished were accepted as members of the Jewish people
without hindrance.  For this, it was sufficient to renounce idolatry
and undergo circumcision.

Here is the first example of what conversion looked like, as described in the Torah:

> And Avraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all
that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Avraham's house,
and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on the same day, as G‑d had
said unto him.  And Avraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was
circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.  And Ishmael his son was thirteen
years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.  On the
same day was Avraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son, and all the men
of his house, born in the house, and bought with money from foreigners,
were circumcised with him.
(Beresheet [17:23-27](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.17.23-27))

The operation of circumcision could have been performed by a member of Avraham's
household — that same Eliezer who placed his hand under Avraham's thigh
(Beresheet [24:9](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.24.9)).  Besides serving
as steward, he could also have been a physician, just as, for example,
Rambam simultaneously fulfilled the duties of a physician and was the head
of the community.

But the midrash Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer
[29:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.29.2) asserts that Avraham
summoned Shem, son of Noah, and on Yom Kippur Shem performed circumcision upon
Avraham and upon his son, Ishmael.  In any case, the circumcision was performed
by non-Jews.

In its essence, circumcision was an act of renunciation of paganism.
But the Jewish people trace their lineage only from Avraham-avinu.
<!-- Avraham was first called a Jew in Beresheet
[14:13](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.14.13). -->  All the other members of
the household who underwent circumcision accepted monotheism — faith in the one
G‑d, but nothing is known of their descendants (including the sons of Keturah,
as well as the lost tribes).  Only the descendants of Avraham are known,
from whom the monotheistic religions arose.

The formation of the Jewish people continued only through Yitzchak
(Beresheet [17:19](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.17.19),
[21:12](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.21.12)),
because he was the first Jew through his father.
And the formation of the foundation of the Jewish people was completed by Yaakov
who was the first Jew through his grandfather.  Yaakov received the name Yisrael
(Beresheet [32:29](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.32.29)),
therefore for his descendants the concept *zera Yisrael* (seed of Yisrael)
was subsequently used.

<!-- Generally we can say that the Jewish people were born with Avraham,
received circumcision, grew and developed, and at Sinai the bar mitzvah was performed.
Therefore, just as full observance of the commandments is not required for children,
so too in the Torah we can find many examples of non-observance before Sinai. -->

The following example of conversion was unsuccessful:

> Only on this condition will we consent to you: if you will become as we are
and every male among you be circumcised.  Then we will give our daughters to
you, and we will take your daughters to ourselves, and we will dwell with you
and become one people.
(Beresheet [34:15-16](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.34.15-16))

Here it is evident that the pagans were required to undergo conversion so that
Jewish identity, transmitted through the father, would pass to the children of
Jewish women who were given in marriage to converts.  But this was a false
conversion, for it was prompted by insincere motives — first, this conversion
was demanded of the inhabitants of Shechem out of fear, to avoid the
consequences of the crime committed by their chieftain's son.  And second, the
conversion was performed out of mercenary interests, in order to be able to
marry Jewish women, to seize the wealth of the Jews, rather than for the service
of G‑d.  Therefore they were first circumcised, and then, to nullify this false
conversion, all these converts were slain.

Yet another example of unsuccessful conversion — when an Egyptian by father
accepted Judaism.  His mother was a Jewess, but Jewishness was passed down
through the father, so he needed to undergo conversion.  But as it later turned
out, his conversion was insincere — he remained a blasphemer, therefore he was
stoned (Vayikra [24:10-23](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.24.10-23)).

The laws of the Torah clearly and unequivocally indicate the necessary
requirements and procedure for undergoing conversion:

> If a stranger sojourns with you and wishes to offer the Pesach to G‑d,
let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it,
and he shall be as one that is born in the land.
(Shemot [12:48](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.12.48))

Clearly, the desire to bring the Pesach to G‑d signifies that the stranger has
renounced the worship of idols and accepted faith in the one G‑d.  Therefore it
sufficed for him to undergo circumcision.  Thus did the Egyptians who joined
during the Exodus become part of the Jewish people, and all who joined during
the return from the Babylonian exile, who wished to separate themselves from
the unclean nations in order to follow only the L‑rd G‑d of Israel (Ezra
[6:21](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezra.6.21)) together with their wives and
children (Nehemiah [10:29](https://www.sefaria.org/Nehemiah.10.29)).

> and you see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you desire her,
and wish to take her as a wife
(Devarim [21:10-14](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.21.10-14))

In this case, Jews are permitted to marry non-Jewish women, because children
born of the captive remain Jews through their father.  But in order for a Jewish
man to marry her, the following procedure is prescribed: let her shave her head
and not cut her nails, and let her sit in the house and mourn for her father and
mother for a month.  In accordance with the logic of Bemidbar
[31](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.31), when she has lost her parents, then
without her father's influence she will no longer turn away the Jewish husband,
as it is said in Devarim [7:3-4](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.3-4),
that the wife's father turns away Jews.

Further, if after 30 days, seeing her in such a disfigured state: bald, with
long curved nails and tear-stained, the man still does not change his mind about
marrying her, then his love is genuine, despite all the problems of mixed marriages.

Gemara <!-- (Yevamot [47b:18](https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.47b.18),
[48a](https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.48a)) -->
clarifies that this procedure applies only when the captive woman does not
voluntarily accept the commandments, because in the case where she voluntarily
accepts the commandments, according to halakha it is sufficient for her simply
to immerse in the mikveh, and then she immediately becomes a Jewess.

But despite what has been said above, nevertheless Jews were permitted
to marry non-Jewish women not from all nations.  In Devarim
[7:1](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.1) a specific list is given of seven
nations with whom it is strictly forbidden to intermarry.  But the grandchildren
of the following nations may enter into the assembly of G‑d:

> You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother; you shall not abhor
an Egyptian, for you were a stranger in his land.  The children of the third
generation that are born unto them may enter into the assembly of the L‑rd.
(Devarim [23:8-9](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.23.8-9))

But the Orthodoxes abhor even Jews by father.

The most exemplary instance of conversion described in the TaNaKh was the
conversion of Ruth, ancestress of King David.  This is recounted in the
*Book of Ruth* (*Megillat Ruth*, *The Scroll of Ruth*).

<!-- I studied the Book of Ruth on the night of the festival of Shavuot,
when I was studying in yeshiva (this new custom involves reading the collection
*Tikkun Leil Shavuot*).  When everyone had already gone to sleep, I stayed later
than all — and continued learning until 4 o'clock in the morning.  Then I napped
a little — and from 7 o'clock in the morning came earlier than anyone and
continued studying.  And all night I was so alert that I could even quickly
calculate the years of shemitah in my mind. -->

Ruth became a Jewess, despite being a Moabite — a member of a nation whose
kinship was so strictly forbidden by the Torah that even their descendants
in the tenth generation were not accepted:

> An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the L‑rd
(Devarim [23:4](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.23.4))

But for Ruth an exception was made on the ground that she was not a Moabite but
a Moabitess.  For this same reason King Shlomo was able to take as wife Naamah
the Ammonitess.  And later the rabbis annulled this law of the Torah, and both
Ammonites and Moabites came to be accepted into the assembly of G‑d, for the
reason that after the mingling of nations by the Assyrians, it became impossible
to determine these nationalities, as is stated in the tractate of the Mishnah
Yadayim [4:4](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yadayim.4.4).
<!-- Repeated in Hilkhot Issurei Biah
[12](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Forbidden_Intercourse.12.25). -->

It is interesting how the Book of Ruth describes the process of conversion.
Ruth became part of the Jewish people after uttering the following phrases:

> For wherever you go, I will go; wherever you lodge, I will lodge;
your people shall be my people, and your G‑d my G‑d.
Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried…
and only death parts me from you!
(Ruth [1:16-17](https://www.sefaria.org/Ruth.1.16-17))

In our time, the pledge “Where you die, I will die” corresponds to a readiness
to follow along with everyone even into the gas chambers of a concentration camp,
that is, to share fully the fate of the Jewish people even in sufferings.
When I visited Babi Yar, I stood over the ravine weeping, imagining with horror
the atrocities of the Nazis, and repeated to myself, “If only they had killed
me instead, if only they had killed me instead…”

Therefore, the most accurate definition of who is a Jew is:
a Jew is one who agrees to suffer solely for belonging to the Jewish people.
For example, upon seeing an announcement «All Jews of the city are required
to appear with their belongings and documents…», I would gather myself and go there.
Or if, G‑d forbid, there would be a queue to the concentration camp furnace,
then I am ready to stand in that line, and before the burning to pronounce
as my last words [Shema Yisrael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shema#Other_instances).
All the more so, since I would have ended up in a concentration camp anyway
under the [Nuremberg laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws).

From my childhood years, I imagined myself in the place of the victims,
each time visiting a concentration camp site.  <!-- Since 1984, when
40 years had passed since the extermination of the prisoners of
the Klooga concentration camp, I have visited this place. -->
And a few years ago I made a series of photographs of Holocaust memorials, and
these photographs were selected for exhibition in the Holocaust museum in Germany.
<!-- ![Klooga Memorial](../../../files/book/klooga_memorial.jpg){:.center} -->

The conversion of Ruth did not require the adoption of a new name.  Ruth
remained with her former name, retroactively interpreted in Hebrew as having
the meaning “satiation”, “saturation”, alluding to the fact that King David
would later satiate G‑d with songs.  Whereas Naomi (a name meaning “pleasant”,
“sweet”) had an additional name Mara (“bitter”).

It should be noted that Naomi was called Ruth's mother-in-law even before she
underwent conversion, because Ruth did not need conversion for a lawful marriage
to Naomi's Jewish son, when Jewishness was transmitted through the father.
And only when Ruth lost her husband, and was not planning to marry again,
and as a single person wished to move to Israel, did she require conversion.
Had she known in advance that she would subsequently marry Boaz,
then conversion would not have been necessary for her.
<!-- And it did not matter to Boaz that she was a Moabite woman.  And indeed
no one was concerned about this: neither the young men whom she refused, nor the
poor, nor the rich.  The main thing for Boaz was that Ruth was a Jewish widow. -->

<!-- Ruth had already joined the Jewish people by virtue of marriage to a Jew.
And after the loss of her husband, she had to confirm her Jewish status
in order to settle in Israel as a separate unit of society.
Also, Ruth bore the obligation of levirate marriage through Naomi's Jewish son. -->
Had Boaz immediately taken Ruth as his wife before she, without a husband,
settled in Israel, there would have been no question of conversion whatsoever.
Therefore, the story of Ruth is dominated by a feminist motif —
previously, the decision regarding a woman's belonging to the Jewish people
was made only by a man who chose to himself a wife from among the nations.
And Ruth was the first woman who independently made such a decision,
unrelated to marriage.

The fact that Ruth underwent conversion not before marrying a Jew, but only when
she lost her husband and wished to resettle among the Jewish people, testifies
that for the marriage of a Jew and a non-Jewish woman, conversion was not
required, because the children of non-Jews inherited Jewishness through the
father.  Therefore the wives of King Shlomo did not undergo conversion either.
And at the end of the Book of Ruth is given the genealogy of King David, where
ancestors are mentioned only through the paternal line.

Later during the time of the Mishnah, doubts arose among the sages of the Talmud
concerning King David's ritual fitness, regarding the validity of the conversion
of his ancestress Ruth the Moabite, notwithstanding the assertion in Bava Batra
[91a](https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.91a.15) that David's mother Nitzevet
bat Adael was a Jewess.
It was known that male Moabite converts were forbidden to marry Jewesses, but
the question under discussion was whether a female convert from Moab had the
right to marry a Jewish man, and whether the descendants of such a union would
be defective mamzerim.  And for illegitimate mamzerim in all generations it was
forbidden not only to marry Jewesses, but also to reign.

The Book of Ruth represents a complete opposition to the requirement of Ezra and
Nehemiah to expel foreign wives.  Formally this appeared such that their
marriages were annulled, therefore having lost their husbands, like Orpah, they
were compelled to return each to her mother's house.  But unlike Ruth, they did
not undergo conversion, despite the fact that in those times the prophet
Zekhariah spoke of the joining of entire nations in
[2:15](https://www.sefaria.org/Zechariah.2.15).  Therefore the Book of Ruth is
the most illustrative example of the category of *chesed*, while the actions
of Ezra and Nehemiah are of the category of *gevurah*.

Based on the Book of Ruth, such a halakha was adopted, that one who desires to
be a Jew is not dissuaded for too long, nor is one overly strict with him
(see Rashi's commentary on the Book of Ruth
[1:18](https://www.sefaria.org/Ruth.1.18?with=Rashi) and Yevamot
[47b](https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.47b)).  But at the present time, the
Orthodoxes demonstrate completely opposite behavior, not following their own
halakha and manifesting the highest degree of *gevurah*.  The Orthodoxes read
the Book of Ruth every year, but do not delve into its meaning, only mechanically
declaiming the words, ignoring the moral of this story about love of one's
neighbor.  Instead, they are guided by the saying of Rabbi Chelbo from Yevamot
[47b](https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.47b.5): “Proselytes are as hard for Israel
as a sore of leprosy”.  <!-- Although now the meaning of this expression
corresponds more to this: “Ba'alei teshuvah are as hard as a sore.”  -->

If in our time the widowed foreign Moabitess Ruth were to come to the Orthodoxes
and ask to be received, she would be refused and would be shamefully expelled by
the Orthodoxes, and she would not be permitted to join the Jewish people (they
would find fault with her, declare that Ruth was doing this out of self-interest
because of her mother-in-law, etc.), and neither King David nor his son Shlomo
would have been born, and there would be no Temple.  That is, in our time the
Orthodoxes continue to engage in the destruction of the Temple.  Therefore,
because of the cruelty of the Orthodoxes, the coming of Mashiach from the line
of David is delayed.

> And many from among the nations of the land became Jews,
for the fear of the Jews had fallen upon them.
(Megillat Esther [8:17](https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.8.17))

This is an example of conversions from the book of Esther, but without details.
Also unknown are the details of how there were accepted into the Jewish people
those who served in the army of King David: Uriah the Hittite (*Uriah HaHitti*),
Zelek the Ammonite (Shmuel II
[23:37](https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.23.37)), Ithmah the Moabite (Divrei
ha‑yamim I [11:46](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.11.46)), etc.

There are other testimonies of conversions.  In the non-canonical book of Yehudit
<!-- «Judith» [14:10](https://www.sefaria.org/Book_of_Judith.14.13) -->
it is recounted how Achior, the leader of the Ammonites, believed in G‑d,
circumcised his foreskin, and joined the house of Israel.

The first historically reliable description of conversion was given by Josephus
Flavius in his extensive work *The Antiquities of the Jews*.  In the twentieth
book, in the [second](https://www.sefaria.org/The_Antiquities_of_the_Jews.20.2)
chapter, a case is recounted wherein, under the influence of Jewish missionaries,
Queen Helena of Adiabene accepted Judaism — notably, not for the sake of
marriage, but for unselfish reasons like Ruth.  Her son Izates also inclined
toward accepting Judaism after becoming acquainted with a Jewish merchant named
Ananias.  Ananias instructed Izates in the virtues of the Jewish religion — and
consequently won him over to his side.  At the same time, King Izates feared how
his subjects would receive his circumcision.  Then Ananias said that one could
join Judaism even without accepting circumcision, and that it was sufficient
only to worship G‑d.  But Izates could not consider himself a true Jew until
he had undergone circumcision.

Thereafter there came to Izates a great scholar of the law, a Galilean Jew named
Eliezer, who persuaded Izates to undergo circumcision.  When Eliezer found
Izates studying the Torah, he reproached him for merely reading the laws but not
fulfilling the chief commandment.  Thereupon the king immediately withdrew to
another room (i.e., Izates himself pronounced the blessings over the
circumcision, not the rabbi), summoned a physician, and commanded him to
perform the operation.  Thus King Izates became a Jew in accordance with the
requirements of the Torah given to Moshe upon Mount Sinai — a person knows
that he must be a Jew, circumcision was performed upon him, and behold, he is
already a full Jew.  In this manner the question of self-identification was
resolved — a person himself decides who he is: if he knows that he
is a Jew, then a Jew he is.

The later-written midrash
Beresheet Rabbah [46:10](https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.46.10)
describes this incident such that two brothers Monobaz and Izates sat
and studied the first book of the Torah, Beresheet.  And when they reached the words
about the necessity of circumcision, they turned away to the wall and wept.
Then each of them went and circumcised himself.  This midrash erroneously called
the brothers sons of King Ptolemy, whereas the historically more accurate
testimony of Josephus Flavius calls them children of King Monobaz — the elder
son of Monobaz was also called Monobaz, and he, following the example of his
brother Izates, also performed circumcision.

The case described above was not an exception.  Mass proselytism was based on
state policy, when as a result of missionary activity entire pagan nations were
converted to Judaism.  The High Priest Yochanan Hyrcanus, after the conquest of
Idumea, made the entire Idumean population Jews.  <!-- Moreover, the descendants
of Esau immediately entered into the assembly of G‑d, and not only beginning
with the grandchildren, as stated in Devarim
[23:8-9](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.23.8-9). -->  King Aristobulus I
conquered part of the territory of the Itureans and converted the inhabitants
to Judaism, compelling them to undergo the rite of circumcision (Josephus
Flavius, The Antiquities of the Jews XIII
[11:3](https://www.sefaria.org/The_Antiquities_of_the_Jews.13.11.3)).

This was a consequence of moral development that contributed to an increase
in humaneness: whereas previously the pagan peoples of Canaan were simply
annihilated, <!-- and assimilated --> in the times of the Second Temple
nations were permitted to live on condition of renouncing idolatry.  In both
cases the goal of complete eradication of idolatry in the territory of the Land
of Israel was fulfilled.  The difference is that the conversion of the pagan
population to Judaism was a more humane means of accomplishing this task.

The result of such a mass conversion was positive — the Edomites became patriots
of Israel and made a great contribution to the development of the state.
Problems from this arose only when the Torah law not to set a foreigner as king
(Devarim [17:15](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.17.15)) was violated, and
Herod the Edomite became king.  <!-- a ruler resembling Stalin -->
<!-- But to be honest, there were also many problems from pure-blooded
Jewish kings, beginning with the first king, who killed priests. -->
<!-- Herod was considered a Jew, despite the fact that his mother was not Jewish,
and only his ancestors through the paternal line had undergone conversion. -->

According to Rambam (Laws of Forbidden Intercourse
[13-14](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Forbidden_Intercourse.13-14))
based on Yevamot [47a-b](https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.47b),
when a non-Jew comes and requests to be accepted, they first inquire as to his
motives, and then inform him of the persecutions to which the Jewish people are
subjected.  And if he confirms that he agrees to all of this, then he is
accepted immediately, without delay.  And they inform him of the main principles
of Judaism — acceptance of faith in the one G‑d and rejection of idolatry, and
enumerate a few of the easy commandments and a few of the difficult ones, but do
not overwhelm him with details, lest they divert him from the correct path.
And if he has not changed his mind and accepts all that has been said, then they
delay no further and immediately perform his circumcision, so as not to postpone
the fulfillment of the mitzvah.  But the Orthodoxes blatantly violate this law.

<!-- Shulchan Arukh Yoreh De'ah
[268](https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.268)
repeats this precise order for accepting idolaters into the Jewish people,
together with clarifications that there is no such thing as “cancellation of
conversion”, even when the converted Jew returns to idolatry. -->

An important observation was made by Rambam in the Laws of Circumcision
[3:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Circumcision.3.7), repeated
in Shulchan Arukh Yoreh De'ah
[268](https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.268.9), that when
an idolater comes and requests circumcision solely for medical reasons, it is
forbidden, because he has no intention of renouncing idolatry, and in accordance
with Avodah Zarah [26b](https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.26a.15), it is
forbidden to heal idolaters — just as it is forbidden to intervene in the life
of wild animals, even for their salvation (later this halakha was abolished
after the decline of paganism among nations).  But when an idolater requests
circumcision necessary for the restoration of health, with the intention of
observing the commandment of renouncing idolatry, then it is a mitzvah to
circumcise him for his healing, when he desires to join the Jewish people.
Therefore, refusal to circumcise him in such a case is a violation of the
mitzvah.

In the Talmud, the sages teach that one must be patient, like Hillel,
but not be too strict, like Shammai.
{: #hillel-shammai title="Hillel and Shammai"}

In tractate Shabbat [31a](https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.31a.7) there is
described a case of how in the days of the Second Temple a certain gentile was
impressed by the vestments of the High Priest (*kohen gadol*) and came to
Shammai with a demand to convert him on condition of appointing him High Priest.
Shammai drove him away with a measuring rod.  Then the gentile came to Hillel,
and Hillel immediately converted him.  Thereafter the convert sat down to study
Torah and learned that even King David had no right to serve in the Temple.
Then the convert apologized for his former demand to be made High Priest, and
thanked Hillel for having brought him under the wings of the Shekhinah.

Here it is evident how clearly *Beit Shammai* represents the category of gevurah,
while *Beit Hillel* chesed.

The Talmud then recounts how converts accepted into the Jewish people by Hillel
once met and said: “The excessive stringency of Shammai could have deprived us
of the entire world, and only the patience of Hillel brought us near to the
Shekhinah.”

In exactly the same way, the excessive stringency of the Orthodoxes deprived me
of an entire world: health, family happiness, opportunities to realize the
abilities given me by G‑d, and so on.

If we compare these stories, in the Talmud the situation appeared such that
a gentile brazenly demanded to be made High Priest, yet despite this Hillel
immediately performed his conversion with circumcision, after which he began
teaching him the commandments, following the order of *na'aseh ve‑nishma* —
“we shall do and we shall hear”.

But at least Shammai could have had some feeble justification for refusal.
Whereas the Orthodoxes drove me away for absolutely nothing.  Unlike the
shameless guy in the Talmud, I demanded nothing, <!-- neither to make me
a rabbi, nor a leader --> but only most humbly asked to be accepted, that
I might serve G‑d, but the Orthodoxes refused without reason.

The tradition of subjecting to persecution can have effect only upon such gentiles,
to whom insolence is inherent.  They need to be driven away, to curb their
insolence and accustom them to humility.  But to Jews, including Jews by father,
modesty is inherent.  Therefore persecutions act upon them oppressively, cause
grievances and suppress the aspiration to become part of the Orthodox community.

I did everything the Orthodox rabbis told me: for example, they said that
on Shabbat I must walk to the synagogue on foot — I rented a very expensive
apartment in the city center near the synagogue, and every Shabbat I walked to
the synagogue on foot; they said which prayers I must recite — I learned them
and began reciting them all the time, etc.  I did exactly everything they said.
But they still refused me.

Therefore the present-day Orthodox rabbis are even worse than Shammai.
WORSE THAN SHAMMAI!

We live at the end of the very last times — never before has it happened that
a person who loves G‑d came to the Orthodoxes, and bleeding out, for many years
begged them to accept him and perform circumcision.  But instead they looked
upon his sufferings with indifference, and in the end, after all humiliations,
cast him out.

When Orthodoxes attempt to follow the Talmud and inquire about the reasons for
wishing to join the Jewish people, for example: perhaps because Jews are so
successful, or because Jews are chosen, etc., they fail to account for a problem
that did not exist in the times when the Talmud was written.  Namely: the Talmud
presented cases when idolaters came who had no connection whatsoever to the
Jewish people.  But when Jews through the paternal line request to be considered
Jews, their motivation is entirely different.

I must honestly confess that the only reason I fully immersed myself in Judaism
is for the return to the faith of my forefathers, for the correction of the
mistakes of my Jewish ancestors who departed from Judaism.  The most precise name
for this motivation is TESHUVAH.  All else is falsehood and deceit, and I can no
longer lie and deceive, as the Orthodoxes demand, denying the right to teshuvah.

<!-- From Jews by paternal lineage, the Orthodoxes demand a black-and-white
teshuvah on an “all or nothing” principle: either you become a full 100%
ultra-Orthodox, or get out of here. -->

The Orthodoxes demanded that I renounce my Jewish ancestors, forget them
entirely and refrain from mentioning them, pretend they never existed, and
thereby desecrate their memory.  Antisemites act in exactly the same way when
they demand that Jews renounce their Jewish roots. <!-- And I wanted to graft
the branch back to the roots. -->  But I am incapable of such betrayal.
I deeply wished to avoid assimilation and continue the Jewish line, so that
Jewish life might flourish, but the Orthodoxes would not permit me to do so,
and only pushed me away from Jewry.

The problem is that contemporary Orthodoxes have misplaced priorities
in the realization of needs.  In accordance with the
[hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs)
presented by Abraham Maslow — and even earlier these ideas were set forth
by Rambam in *Moreh Nevukhim*
[3:27](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_Part_3.27.4) —
human needs are distributed across the following stages:

1. Physiological needs
2. Safety
3. Family
4. Respect
5. Knowledge

This can also be projected onto the tree of sefirot and the levels of the soul's
revelation: physical, emotional, intellectual — *nefesh*, *ruach*, *neshamah*,
which is also known as the ladder of Baal HaSulam.
<!-- And in Pirkei Avot [3:17](https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.3.17)
this same principle is formulated more briefly: “Where there is no bread —
there is no Torah.” -->

So here is the problem: the Orthodoxes place the need for acceptance into an
Orthodox community at the fourth level, i.e., they readily and without delay
accept someone when that person has completely settled in life — has a family,
an established household, and the only thing that person lacks is respect and
recognition from the Orthodox community.  And only after acceptance into the
community and the subsequent receipt of recognition and respect does the
transition to the next level occur — knowledge, the unhurried calm study of Torah
under the guidance of rabbis, etc.

But my need to join an Orthodox community stood in the very first place: above all
I needed to undergo circumcision (1st level), in order to guarantee safety for
my health (2nd level), so that I could establish a Jewish family (3rd level),
and only then calmly study Torah with the community.  That is, it was necessary
to act precisely in accordance with the principle of *na'aseh ve‑nishma* —
first do what is required, and only then calmly engage in study.

This did not fit into the conception of today's Orthodoxy, which regards joining
an Orthodox community as a luxury rather than a necessity.  In this the
Orthodoxes demonstrate complete indifference, incomprehension, and disregard
for the vital needs of people.

For the purpose of marriage to Jews, non-Jewish women are readily accepted,
who have an established household, know how to cook meat and prepare
various dishes, and it costs them nothing to simply
buy meat at another store with kashrut certificates.
<!-- And vegetarians have no problems whatsoever with the Orthodoxes. -->
But at the same time they do not accept solitary unsettled men who wish to
draw near to G‑d.  The Orthodoxes require one to possess culinary abilities and
master the profession of a cook, and without this they will not accept.  The
logic is such: if one cannot prepare meat dishes, then one has no right to
receive Divine light and participate in its dissemination.

As a result, through blackmail and the threat of preventing marriage, they
force conversion on those non-Jewish women who have no need whatsoever for
Jewishness.  That is, they effectively perform forced conversion, which is even
worse than proselytizing.  Yet they do not accept those who cannot live without
Jewishness.  This is a tremendous injustice, having nothing in common with Judaism.
<!-- This is no longer Orthodox Judaism, but Orthodoxy. -->

The Torah calls for justice, yet among the Orthodoxes there still remains
a tremendous injustice that causes irreparable harm to Judaism and brings about
much suffering.

And then I thought that perhaps the Orthodoxes refused to accept me because
I am already a Jew through my father's line, and Jews do not need conversion.
But then the fault of the Orthodoxes remains in that they refused to perform
circumcision on a Jew, as the Torah requires.
{: #patrilineal title="Patrilineality"}

And indeed, the Torah teaches that Jewishness is transmitted through the father.
The Jewish patriarchs took non-Jewish women as wives, but their children were
Jews.  Nowhere in the Torah is there mentioned a single case in which Jewishness
would be transmitted through the maternal line.

The very first commandment of the Torah unambiguously states that circumcision
must be performed on all who are of the seed of Avraham, that is, Jews through
the paternal line:

> This is My covenant, which you shall keep, between Me and you, and your seed
after you: every male among you shall be circumcised.  And you shall
circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be a sign of the covenant
between Me and you.  On the eighth day shall every male among you be
circumcised throughout your generations — he that is born in the house, and he
that is bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your seed.  He that
is born in your house, and he that is bought with your money, must be circumcised,
and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.  And the
uncircumcised male who does not circumcise the flesh of his foreskin — that soul
shall be cut off from his people, for he has broken My covenant.
(Beresheet [17:10-14](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.17.10-14))

Here it is stated with utmost clarity at the level of *peshat* that the
obligation to observe the commandment of circumcision applies to all Jews who
are *of your seed* — *mi‑zarakha*.  One who is of your seed — these are Jews,
while those purchased from foreign nations who are not of your seed must undergo
conversion.  This means that according to the Torah, Jews through the paternal
line are considered Jews, and therefore they are required to undergo
circumcision.  This is an eternal covenant, and therefore it cannot be nullified
by any later discussions in the Talmud.

Consequently, one who refuses to perform circumcision on a Jew by paternal
lineage violates one of the most important commandments of the Torah.

In many places where the Torah speaks of the descendants of Avraham and Yisrael,
the word *zera* (seed) is used.  The use of this word is traced back to the
Qumran scrolls of the Second Temple period.  This term implies the indisputable
fact that Jewishness is transmitted through the seed via the male line.

Here are several examples:

> And your seed shall be like the dust of the earth
(Beresheet [28:14](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.28.14))

> his sons and his sons' sons with him, his daughters
and his sons' daughters, and all his seed
(Beresheet [46:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.46.7))

> I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven,
and all this land of which I have spoken I will give to your seed
(Shemot [32:13](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.32.13))

> And of your seed (*u‑mi‑zarakha*) you shall not allow anyone to pass through to Molech
(Vayikra [18:21](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.18.21))

> And because He loved your fathers, He chose their seed after them
(Devarim [4:37](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.4.37))

> life and death have I set before you, blessing and curse —
therefore choose life, so that you may live, you and your seed
(Devarim [30:19](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.30.19))

> Seed of Avraham, His servant, children of Yaakov, His chosen ones!
(Tehillim [105:6](https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.105.6))

> Seed of Yisrael, His servant, sons of Yaakov, His chosen ones!
(Divrei ha‑yamim I [16:13](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.16.13))

The definition of Jewishness through the father was given
for all times, forever, as it is said:

> Only your fathers did G‑d love and chose their seed after them, you,
from all nations, as it is this day.
(Devarim [10:15](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.10.15))

> And that your days may be prolonged upon the land which G‑d swore unto your
fathers to give unto them and to their seed — a land flowing with milk and honey.
(Devarim [11:9](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11.9))

Therefore, even today Israel accepts *zera Yisrael* — sons and grandsons of
Jews, following the commandments of the Torah:

> And G‑d appeared to Avram, and said: to your seed I give this land
(Beresheet [12:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.12.7))

> all the land that you see I give to you and to your seed forever.
And I will make your seed as the dust of the earth
(Beresheet [13:15-16](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.13.15-16))

> G‑d made a covenant with Avram, saying: to your seed have I given this land
(Beresheet [15:18](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.15.18))

This is a commandment of Zionism — the commandment to settle in Israel,
including for Jews through the paternal line.

The main principle for determining Jewish identity is set forth in the Book of Yeshayahu.
After mention of the concept of the seed of Avraham in [41:8](https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.41.8),
there follows:

> I will pour My spirit upon your seed
(Yeshayahu [44:3](https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.44.3))

This means that the Jewish soul is transmitted through the seed.

An important clarification is given in the following words:

> One shall say: I am the L‑rd's, and another shall call himself
by the name of Yaakov, and another shall inscribe with his hand:
of the L‑rd, and adopt the name of Yisrael.
(Yeshayahu [44:5](https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.44.5))

From this follows the most precise definition of Jewishness: a Jew is one
who is of the seed of Abraham and considers himself a Jew.

The following statement confirms this fact:

> your seed shall stand firm, and your name
(Yeshayahu [66:22](https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.66.22))

The seed is genetic heredity, while the name is conscious belonging
to the Jewish people.

For example, the twin brothers Yaakov and Esav were both of Avraham's seed, but
Esav did not consider himself a Jew, voluntarily renounced his Jewishness and
abandoned the covenant with G‑d, therefore his offspring did not belong to the
Jewish people.  <!-- In the same way, the circumcised Jew Yishmael departed from
Jewishness, whom Avraham had planned to make the continuation of his lineage. -->
<!-- And the sons of Keturah renounced Jewishness like Esav. -->
But Yaakov was a Jew through his grandfather and considered himself a Jew,
therefore his descendants remained Jews.  Precisely the same principle is
preserved in the present time: each of Avraham's descendants who feels
within himself a Jewish soul is a Jew.

In Soviet times the renunciation of Jewishness had no force, since it was
performed under duress — the majority of Jews in the Soviet Union were compelled
to conceal their Jewishness.  But after that they and their descendants did not
cease to be Jews.  For example, Moshe had Jewish origins with an Egyptian
upbringing, just as Soviet Jews did — and this did not prevent him from later
leading the Jewish people.  That is, one ceases to be a Jew only when one
voluntarily renounces Jewishness, not under pressure.  Just as
[Marranos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marrano) did not cease to be Jews, so
too Soviet Jews were *[anusim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anusim)*
(“coerced ones”) — Jews forcibly converted to the communist religion.
<!-- It is interesting to note that there exists also the reverse term
“[reverse Marranos](https://web.archive.org/web/20240706081519/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Marranos)”,
who in Hebrew are called *haredim anusim* — “Haredim under duress”. -->

Many sages also repeatedly mentioned the term *zera Yisrael*.  For example,
Rambam in *Sefer HaMitzvot* specified as a separate additional commandment number
[M−362](https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot,_Negative_Commandments.362)
that a king and indeed any leader must be *zera Yisrael*.
The same is found in *Sefer HaChinukh* under number
[498](https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.498.2?with=Mishneh%20Torah,%20Kings%20and%20Wars)
with the explanation that the compassion inherent in Jews
is transmitted from a Jewish father to his children.

Some Orthodoxes attempt to trace Jewish lineage through the matriarchs, but this
makes no sense.  The Midrash reports that the mother of Rachel and Leah was <!-- tender -->
Adina, and Bilhah and Zilpah were also daughters of Laban, but their mothers
were concubines, like Hagar with Abraham.  It is also known that the mother of
Bethuel, Rivkah's father, was Milcah.  But this does not mean they were Jews.
Whereas the transmission of Jewishness through the paternal line is traced
absolutely unambiguously: Abraham → Isaac → Jacob.

<!-- And the matriarchs received their Jewishness through their husbands.
But it is unknown at what moment — perhaps Rachel became Jewish only after
the incident with the teraphim.  But most likely the matriarchs came to be
considered Jewish retroactively after the formation of the Jewish people. -->

<!-- The same midrash (Seder Olam Rabbah) reports that Leah and Rachel
were twins.  And this makes sense: the twin sisters were so alike that
they could not be distinguished from one another.  It is possible that during
the day Leah wore spectacles, and at night came to Yaakov without spectacles,
which is why he confused her with Rachel. -->

<!-- One who maintains that Sarah was a Jewess, like Avraham, must also
acknowledge that their Jewishness was transmitted through the paternal line,
for they had a common father but different mothers (Beresheet
[20:12](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.20.12)).  The name of Avraham's
mother is not even mentioned in the Torah (but only in Bava Batra
[91a](https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.91a.14) is it said to be Amatlai),
for it is immaterial to the transmission of Jewishness.  As for Sarah,
her mother is altogether unknown. -->

Throughout the Torah <!-- and correspondingly in the prayers -->
it speaks of the G‑d of the fathers, not the mothers, because Jewishness
was always transmitted through the father.  For example:

> And said: I am the G‑d of your father
(Shemot [3:6](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.3.6))

> Thus shall you say to the children of Yisrael: the L‑rd, the G‑d of your fathers
(Shemot [3:15](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.3.15))

> This is my G‑d, and I will glorify Him, the G‑d of my father, and I will exalt Him
(Shemot [15:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.15.2))

The following passages, where the G‑d of the fathers is mentioned already
after the giving of the Torah, constitute the central part of the text
of the Passover Haggadah:

> I have come to the land that the L‑rd swore to our fathers to give us
(Devarim [26:3](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.26.3))

> we cried out unto the L‑rd, the G‑d of our fathers
(Devarim [26:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.26.7))

> the land that You have given us, as You swore to our fathers
(Devarim [26:15](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.26.15))

> they forsook the covenant of the L‑rd, the G‑d of their fathers
(Devarim [29:24](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.29.24))

> they forsook the L‑rd, the G‑d of their fathers, who brought them
out of the land of Egypt
(Shoftim [2:12](https://www.sefaria.org/Judges.2.12))

All these expressions migrated unchanged into the prayers, and to this day
the siddurim mention both “G‑d of my fathers” and “G‑d of our fathers”.

In the Torah, children of non-Jewish women from Jewish fathers were considered Jews.
For example, among *bnei Yisrael*, the sons of Yisrael (and not of Rachel and Leah),
that is, among the Jews, there is mentioned the son of a non-Jewish woman, Shaul:

> and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman
(Beresheet [46:10](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.46.10))

> and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman
(Shemot [6:15](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.6.15))

The Torah here unambiguously states that the son of the Jew Shimon and the
Canaanite woman was a Jew, a son of Yisrael.  Other Jews also took non-Jewish
wives, e.g., Egyptian women, Midianite women, but Shimon took a wife from the
forbidden nations, therefore the Torah emphasizes this.

This Canaanite woman is commonly identified as the daughter of Dinah.
Then the mother of Shaul is called a Canaanite because her father was the
gentile Shekhem.  <!-- And probably Shimon took her as a wife because of how
the inhabitants of Canaan treated Dinah (Beresheet Rabbah
[80:11](https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.80.11)). -->  But despite the
fact that she was the daughter of the Jewess Dinah, she was still considered
a non-Jewess.  That is, the daughter of the non-Jewish father Shekhem and the
Jewish mother Dinah was a Canaanite, notwithstanding that she grew up among Jews.

> And Yehudah saw there the daughter of a certain Kenaani whose name was Shua
(Beresheet [38:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.38.2))

Yehudah took as wife a Canaanite woman, daughter of Shua, despite the existing
tradition in their family not to marry Canaanite women.  Later in the times of
Zekhariah <!-- [14:21](https://www.sefaria.org/Zechariah.14.21) --> the word
*kenaani* came to denote merchants.  But in Divrei ha‑yamim I
[2:3](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.2.3) it is explicitly stated that
the daughter of Shua was a Canaanite woman — “Bat Shua, knaanit”.
And Rashi in his commentary on Beresheet
[37:35](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.37.35?with=Rashi) said in the words of
Rabbi Nehemiah that the sons of Yaakov had wives from the daughters of Canaan.

> and gave Yosef for a wife Asenat, the daughter of Poti-phera, priest of On
(Beresheet [41:45](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.41.45))

> And unto Yosef were born two sons, whom Asenat the daughter of the priest
of On bore unto him.  And Yosef called the name of the firstborn Manasseh.
And the second he called Efraim.
(Beresheet [41:50-52](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.41.50-52))

> And unto Yosef were born in the land of Egypt Manasseh and Ephraim,
whom Asenat the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On bore unto him
(Beresheet [46:20](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.46.20))

The progenitors of the tribes were born to a non-Jewish mother, but were Jews
through their father.  Their mother, though she was the daughter of an Egyptian
priest, did not turn them away from Judaism.  One of the sons of Manasseh was
born of an Aramean concubine
(Divrei ha‑yamim I [7:14](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.7.14)),
but he was a Jew.  <!-- by grandfather -->

<!--
Some Orthodoxes believe in the legend that Asenat was the daughter of Dinah by
Shechem, whom an angel carried as an infant on its wings to Egypt and laid upon
the border at the “Great Egyptian Wall”.  Others spin fairy tales that the wives
of the patriarchs underwent conversion, ignoring the fact that for conversion
they had no necessary beit din consisting of three Jews.
-->

The children of Moshe — Gershom and Eliezer — were Jews through their father,
born of a non-Jewish woman.  Their mother Tzipporah was a Midianite by origin,
one of the daughters of Yithro, the Midianite priest.  And in the Torah there is
described an instance when a non-Jewish woman was obligated to perform
circumcision upon her Jewish son:

> And Tzipporah took a flint knife and cut off the foreskin of her son
(Shemot [4:25](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.4.25))

G‑d requires circumcision for Jews by paternal line — *zera Yisrael*, even when
their mother is a non-Jewess.  This means that G‑d Himself determines the
transmission of Jewishness through the paternal line.  The children of Moshe by
a non-Jewess were considered Jews by G‑d, therefore it was vitally necessary to
circumcise them.  Under threat of death, G‑d compelled the circumcision of the
Jewish children of a non-Jewess.

Precisely so in my case as well — under threat of death G‑d compelled
circumcision for me as a Jew through the paternal line, yet the Orthodoxes
ignored the command of G‑d.

<!--
This also teaches that circumcision for Jews may be performed not only by women,
but also by non-Jews.
-->

The other daughter of Yithro was taken in marriage by Elazar, son of Aharon,
and there was born to them <!-- named with an Egyptian name --> Pinehas
(Shemot [6:25](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.6.25)).  Thus, the son
of a Jew and a Midianite woman became one of the greatest opponents
of assimilation, when he slew a Jew and a Midianite woman
(Bemidbar [25:7-15](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.25.7-15)).
In Sanhedrin [82b](https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.82b.6)
it is recounted how Pinehas was humiliated with such words:
“Behold how this grandson of Puti undertakes vigilante executions without trial
and investigation, which he learned from his mother's father — the idolater Yithro,
who fattened calves for sacrificial offerings to idols”.  But in response
to these accusations he was vindicated in that on the other side through the
paternal line Pinehas was a grandson of Aharon.  From the example of this case
it becomes clear what the difference is: the daughters of Yithro did not turn
Jews away, whereas in Bemidbar [25](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.25)
the Midianite women inclined the Jews toward idolatry.  Therefore the Talmud
approves such vigilante justice — in the Mishnah Sanhedrin
[9:6](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.9.6) and
BT Sanhedrin [81b](https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.81b.17)
it is stated that for relations with an Aramean woman extrajudicial
executions are carried out by zealots: *kanna'im pog'in bo*.
Because the Aramean women also turned Jews away.  In what did this manifest itself?
JT Sanhedrin [9:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.9.7.4)
clearly answers: it is when the children of a Jew and a non-Jewish woman
grow up as enemies of the Omnipresent.

<!-- Half-breeds often have to prove that they are greater Jews.  Likewise when
Jews attempt to rise in some nation, they develop more strongly the qualities
characteristic of that nation.  So too I have always had to prove that I possess
greater Jewish faculties and a more Jewish worldview than many Jews. -->

Non-Jewish wives were found among Jewish kings, but their children were Jews.
If anyone had tried to insult the king by saying that his children were not
Jews, he would have paid for it immediately.  King David, transmitting
Jewishness to his son, said: “And you, Shlomo, my son, know the G‑d of your
father and serve Him” (Divrei ha‑yamim I [28:9](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.28.9)).
The children of King Shlomo were Jews through their father, despite the fact
that his non-Jewish wives did not undergo conversion, but continued in idolatry.
As stated in Hilkhot Issurei Biah
[13](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Forbidden_Intercourse.13.15),
the beit din did not conduct conversions during the time of Shlomo.
The king had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines
(Melakhim I [11:3](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.11.3)),
among whom were many foreign women: besides the daughter of Pharaoh of Egypt
(Melakhim I [3:1](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.3.1)) there were
Moabite women, Ammonite women, Edomite women, etc. — from nations concerning whom
there existed a warning that they might turn one away from the service of G‑d.
And indeed, they inclined the king toward idolatry.

The mother of the first king of Judah, Rehoboam, was Naamah the Ammonitess
(Melakhim I [14:21,31](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.14.21-31)).  In the responsum
Noda bi‑Yehudah [1](https://www.sefaria.org/Noda_BiYhudah_I,_Choshen_Mishpat.1),
wonder is expressed in connection with the fact that Rambam stated in Mishneh
Torah Hilkhot Melakhim u‑Milchamot
[1](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Kings_and_Wars.1.4) that one must
appoint as king a Jew through the mother, yet Rehoboam became a Jewish king
through the father.  And further it is acknowledged, in accordance with the
opinion of Tosafot, that Jews through the father are permitted to be appointed
to leadership positions, even as king, especially when the dynasty is already
established.

On the other hand, when a non-Jewish king took Jewish wives, their children were
non-Jews.  For example, as Rashi notes in his commentary on the book of Ezra
[4:24](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezra.4.24?with=Rashi), the son of the Persian
king Ahasuerus and Esther was the Persian king Darius, naturally a non-Jew,
despite the fact that his mother was a Jewess.

<!-- Indirect evidence for the transmission of Jewish identity through the
paternal line also includes references to this theme in the works of foreign
authors who were familiar with Jewish customs.  For example, the Greek author
Juvenal in his verses (Satires 14:96-106) mentions that if the father is a Jew,
then the son must honor the Sabbath, pray, not eat pork, undergo circumcision,
study Torah, etc.  In Acts 16:1-3, a story is recounted in which the son of
a Hellene and a Jewess underwent conversion. -->

When the Jewish king gave his Jewish kinswomen in marriage to non-Jewish kings,
the non-Jews were required to convert to Judaism with circumcision in order to
marry (Josephus, *Antiquities of the Jews*
XVI [7](https://www.sefaria.org/The_Antiquities_of_the_Jews.16.7),
XX [7](https://www.sefaria.org/The_Antiquities_of_the_Jews.20.7)).
That is, just as non-Jewish women are now compelled to undergo conversion to
contract marriage with a Jew, formerly non-Jews had to undergo conversion for
marriage with a Jewish woman.  This demonstrates that before marrying a Jewish
woman, a non-Jewish man had to undergo conversion so that her children would be
considered Jews, since Jewishness was transmitted through the father.

Among Ethiopian Jews, Samaritans, Karaites, who share common roots with Rabbinic
(Talmudic) Judaism, the original tradition of transmitting religious status
through the father has been preserved.  Even among the Sadducees, Jewishness was
transmitted through the father in accordance with the laws of the Written Torah.
This means that among the common ancestors it was accepted to determine the
transmission of Jewishness through the paternal line —
[patrilineality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrilineality).  And only
after the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Second Temple did
a reform begin in Rabbinic Judaism toward a transition to
[matrilineality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrilineality), despite the
fact that there was no such decree of the Sanhedrin canceling the law of the
Torah concerning the transmission of Jewishness through the paternal line.
<!-- The Sanhedrin could not have adopted such a decision if only because
there were many Sadducees in its composition.  -->

In the period that followed immediately after the destruction of the Second
Temple, terrible times befell when women were subjected to violence at the hands
of Roman invaders, and therefore it was impossible to establish the paternity of
a child born.  It became urgently necessary to introduce changes into the oral law,
so that a child born to a single Jewish woman would be considered a Jew —
regardless of who his unknown father was.

In the Talmud, recorded two hundred years after the destruction of the Second
Temple, several directions of discourse can be traced:

1. The question was raised for discussion whether one could
   be considered a Jew through the mother alone.
2. Some rabbis attempted to object to determination through the mother,
   but opinions to retain it later prevailed.
3. They cast doubt upon the transmission of Jewishness through the
   paternal line on the grounds that it had become not always possible
   to determine the father with certainty.

And what's more, this last question was not discussed directly (e.g., here is
a person whose only father is Jewish, who is he, is he not a Jew, does he need
conversion), but only in connection with the concept of *mamzerut*, i.e.,
whether there was a forbidden union placing the children in the category of
*mamzerim*.  The following situation created a problem: a Jewish wife's Jewish
husband went missing during the war, and she had to give birth to a child by
a non-Jewish occupier.  Would her child be considered a mamzer, or would it be
simpler to recognize him as a non-Jew so that he would not suffer from the
lifelong stigma of a mamzer.

In Yevamot [45a](https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.45a.4) a case is brought
where a Jewish captive woman was raped by a gentile and then redeemed from
captivity.  She came to a rabbi to ask what status her child would have when
born.  The rabbi began enumerating the names of legal authorities according to
whom her child would be a mamzer.  Then another rabbi, out of compassion for the
single mother, protested and said: “Is it so important to enumerate all these
people?” — meaning that even if all these great sages held such an opinion,
their opinion is not important for determining the halakhah.  And further he
enumerated the names of other rabbis according to whom such a child is not
considered a mamzer.  But then he added that nevertheless according to halakhah
such a child is a mamzer, and enumerated the opinions of rabbis who consider
the child a mamzer.

Later another rabbi proposed to consider children of a non-Jew and a Jewess “tainted”,
<!-- as in the expression “tainted reputation” — “pagum”, -->
<!-- genetically --> “flawed”, “defective”,
and such defective children are forbidden marriages with kohanim.

The general framework within which the discussions proceeded is as follows:
when there exists a prohibition on certain types of relations, do children born
as a result of such forbidden relations have the status of mamzer, and do they
inherit from the mother her status: the status of being in slavery, is there
an obligation of levirate marriage, etc.

In Mishnah Kiddushin [3](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kiddushin.3.12) by the
beginning of the third century CE, such a rule was introduced that when there
are no violations of the law, Jewish status is transmitted through the father.
But when one of the parents has a “defect”, then through the “incorrect” parent.
For example, a child is a mamzer when one of his parents is a mamzer.  Likewise,
a child inherits the nationality of that parent who entered into an unlawful
marriage with Jews.  Any marriage with gentiles is declared unlawful in
accordance with such an interpretation of the words of Sanhedrin
[52b](https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.52b.22) with reference to Vayikra
[20:10](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.20.10), that the prohibition against
committing adultery with one's neighbor's wife excludes the wife of a gentile.

The page of tractate Kiddushin [68b](https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.68b)
of the Babylonian Talmud begins with the question: whence is it derived that
relations with a Canaanite maidservant are unlawful.  Rav Huna said that in the
Torah it is written that when Avraham went to offer Yitzchak as a sacrifice,
he said to his servants: “Remain with the donkey”, therefore it is derived
from this that servants are like donkeys, and since relations with animals
are forbidden, relations with a Canaanite maidservant are likewise considered
invalid.  The comparison of people to animals is also brought in Kilayim
[8:4](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kilayim.8.4), where it is said that mules
born of a donkey and a horse are permitted to mate with horses, i.e., it is
claimed that the son of a mare is a stallion, even when his father is a donkey.

<!-- It is interesting that this comparison with animals in the Talmud was
copied from idolaters.  Idolaters were asked: from the mating of a mare with a donkey,
does one get a horse after the mother or a donkey after the father?  And they
answered that one gets a mule, and that animals cannot be compared with human
beings: the son of a man from the nobility varna and a Brahmin girl himself
decides whether he is a Brahmin.  Likewise, the son of a Brahmin and a girl
from the nobility varna may also consider himself a Brahmin.  A shocking example
of a more humane attitude among idolaters, even with a rigid caste hierarchy,
compared to the Orthodoxes. -->

The question then arises: whence is it derived that the children of a Canaanite
maidservant inherit her status.  The justification brought is a passage from the
Torah in Shemot [21:4](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.21.4), which states that
when the master of a Jewish slave gives him a maidservant as wife, then after he
goes free, the children remain with the Jewish master.  Based on this, Yevamot
[22b](https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.22b) claims that just as slavery is
transmitted through the mother, so too Jewishness is transmitted through the
mother.  But in truth this does not mean that the children are considered
non-Jews.  What is stated here is only that the children inherit the status of
slave from their father, but they do not go free merely because it is said:
“If you buy a Jewish servant, in the seventh year he shall go out free”.
The key words are “If you buy”.  But if Jews are born into slavery, they remain
in slavery to the Jewish master even after the liberation of their Jewish father.
That is, the maximum term of slavery of seven years does not apply to the
children of a Jewish slave.  Even when the children of a Jewish slave are
born of a Jewish maidservant, they are not freed when they reach seven years.
Shemot [21:9](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.21.9) does not obligate giving
a Jewish maidservant as wife only to the master's son, for it is said:
“If he designates her unto his son”.  The key words are “If he designates”.
But if he does not designate, he may give a Jewish maidservant as wife to
a Jewish slave, and their children are considered as belonging to the master
and are not freed.

Despite the fact that this passage says nothing about the transmission of
Jewishness, and moreover the Canaanite maidservant was obligated to fulfill all
the commandments while living in a Jewish household, there still remained the
question of how to connect the Canaanite maidservant and the *nokhrit*, how to
extend this conclusion about the inheritance of status to all foreign women.

And here <!-- also in Yevamot [23a](https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.23a.11) -->
Rabbi Yochanan <!-- bar Napaha --> shared the opinion
that Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai said
that the words of Devarim [7:3-4](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.3-4)
should be understood such that a grandson from an Israelite woman is called your son,
but a grandson from a *nokhrit* is not called your son, but her son, therefore
the son of a *nokhrit* must be considered as belonging to the *nokhrim*.

Firstly, it is noteworthy that this opinion was not universally known, but
rather specific names are cited for those who devised this connection to words
from the Torah.  Such retrofitting of new prohibitions and stringencies after
the fact (a posteriori) is called
*[asmachta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asmachta_(Talmudical_hermeneutics))* —
searching for vague allusions at the level of derash in the text of the Torah
to justify some halakhic ruling, in order to establish for it the status of
*de'oraita* — a law of the Torah.  Yet allegory does not nullify the plain meaning;
*derash* cannot nullify *peshat*, that is, the text of the Written Torah cannot be
interpreted in such a way as to nullify the plain meaning.  Transmission of
Jewishness through the father is *peshat*, the plain meaning in its direct sense.
The claim of transmission through the mother is an attempt to find a hidden
meaning at the level of derash, and this constitutes additions to the Torah.
This is confirmed in Shabbat [63a](https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.63a.14):
*ein mikra yotze mi‑yedei pshuto* — Scripture does not depart from its plain
meaning.  <!-- It is also interesting that Rav Kahana remarks in this very
place in the Talmud that he studied the entire Talmud but did not know of
this principle until age 18 — just as the Orthodoxes now study only the Talmud
to the detriment of studying the Torah. -->

It is impossible to imagine that at the present time, when the opinion
determining Jewishness through the mother is widely prevalent among Orthodoxes,
someone would suddenly say, for greater persuasiveness, that this is the opinion
of one contemporary rabbi and name him.  In his commentary on Bava Metzia
[33b](https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.33b.1?with=Rashi), Rashi reported that
when Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi was recording the Mishnah, he did not mention the
author's name if he agreed with him.  Otherwise, he would indicate the name of
the author of the disputed opinion, which was not included in the Halakha.

This means that the reference to Devarim
[7:3-4](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.3-4) was not only unknown from
Sinai, but was not even known before the fixation of the oral laws.  Otherwise
it would have been known to all, there would have been no discussions, and
there would have been no need to mention that this was the invention of one
specifically named rabbi, devised in the middle of the second century C.E.

Second, the prohibition against intermarriage was given only in relation to the
seven nations of Canaan.  This warning was given against the seven nations
because these nations were idolaters with abominable practices, permitting
forbidden unions that consequently produce something akin to mamzerim.
But even medieval rabbis could not agree among themselves whether this
restriction extends to all nations.  In cases where a non-Jewish woman does not
turn a Jewish man away, there would seem to be nothing wrong.  On the contrary:
Miriam and Aharon provoked G‑d's wrath when they reproached Moshe for the Cushite
woman whom he had taken to wife.  Therefore one cannot always condemn a Jew who
has taken a non-Jewish woman to wife — their children may grow up to be worthy Jews.

But nevertheless it should be acknowledged that anyone can lead astray anyone else.
Both non-Jewish mothers and non-Jewish fathers can lead astray.
Throughout the entire TaNaKh numerous cases are recorded where
Jews took non-Jewish women as wives, who, being under the influence of
other religions of their fathers, often preserved their customs in their
husband's house, and thereby exerted an evil influence both on the husband
and on the children.  For example, in Melakhim I
[16:30-33](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.16.30-33) it is recorded how King
Ahab took as wife Jezebel, daughter of the king of Sidon, and under his wife's
influence King Ahab began to serve Baal, to worship asherahs and to persecute
the prophets.  Therefore the prophets insisted that Jews not marry non-Jewish
women, for they often lead their husbands astray.

Now we must consider this admonition in a broader context and enumerate its
principal mentions.  As with most commandments given in the legislative portion
of the Torah, they are first prefaced by illustrative examples.

Just as programming languages are divided into
[declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) and
[imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming),
the Written Torah consists of texts of two types:

1. the declarative (descriptive, narrative) part;
2. the imperative (legislative, commanding) part.

The declarative part describes various stories from the lives of the ancestors,
first recounting events that befell them, while the imperative part often
refers to these instances when explicating the laws, using them as examples of
conduct in diverse situations.

The oral tradition duplicates this division and likewise contains two parts:
the aggadic (narratives) and the halakhic (the laws).

In the process of the development of civilization, certain laws become
inapplicable to contemporary realities, e.g., laws concerning slaves, etc.,
and therefore transition from the category of the imperative to the
declarative — for history.

Thus in this case under consideration as well — first an example was given
in the first book of the Torah, when the idolaters said to the Jews:

> intermarry with us: give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves
(Beresheet [34:9](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.34.9))

Here a contrast is evident: first an illustrative example is shown of how one
ought not to act — a counterexample, as justification for a later law.
Then, in precisely the same expressions, prohibitions follow
in the second book of the Torah:

> Beware of making a covenant with the inhabitants of the land
into which you will come, lest it become a snare in your midst; …
And he will call you, and you shall eat of his sacrifice.
And you shall take of his daughters for your sons, and his daughters shall
go astray after their gods, and cause your sons to go astray after their gods.
(Shemot [34:12-16](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.34.12-16))

And further, the same prohibition of mixed marriages leading to assimilation
among idolaters was given in the fifth book of the Torah:

> You shall not intermarry with them: your daughter do not give to his son,
and his daughter do not take for your son, for he will turn away
your son from following Me.
(Devarim [7:3-4](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.3-4))

This warning is repeated further in the books of the prophets:

> If you turn away from G‑d and attach yourselves to the remnant of
these nations, then know that they shall be a snare and a trap unto you
(Yehoshua [23:12-13](https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.23.12-13))

On this very matter, Ezra and Nehemiah warn:

> Do not give your daughters to their sons, and do not take their daughters for your sons
(Ezra [9:12](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezra.9.12))

> Do not give your daughters to their sons, and do not take their daughters for
your sons or for yourselves.  For in this did Shlomo, king of Yisrael, sin… —
and even he was led into sin by foreign wives!
(Nehemiah [13:25](https://www.sefaria.org/Nehemiah.13.25))

As can be seen, this recurring theme runs through the entire TaNaKh.
First, the Jewess Dinah risked acquiring a non-Jewish husband, and then
a prohibition was given against Jewish women marrying non-Jewish men,
and likewise against Jewish men marrying non-Jewish women.

It would seem that everything here is perfectly clear and understandable.

But after the destruction of the Second Temple, in connection with the
completely altered way of life and the impossibility of identifying the father
of a child, the rabbis needed to devise a justification for their new
enactments, and here they attempted to find a foothold in the words:

> (Devarim [7:3-4](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.3-4)) וְלֹ֥א תִתְחַתֵּ֖ן בָּ֑ם בִּתְּךָ֙ לֹא־תִתֵּ֣ן לִבְנ֔וֹ וּבִתּ֖וֹ לֹא־תִקַּ֥ח לִבְנֶֽךָ׃ כִּֽי־יָסִ֤יר אֶת־בִּנְךָ֙ מֵֽאַחֲרַ֔י

Literally, this translates as follows:

> You shall not intermarry with them: your daughter do not give to his son,
and his daughter do not take for your son, otherwise will turn away
your son from following Me.
(Devarim [7:3-4](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.3-4))

To convey the meaning of the phrase more precisely, instead of the words
“will turn away” some translations use the phrase “this will turn away”
in the sense that kinship with idolaters will turn away.  The translation
“they will turn away” is also used in the sense that the idolaters will turn away.

But the omitted pronoun constitutes an unambiguous
[ellipsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis_(linguistics)),
whose meaning is implicitly assumed and unequivocally revealed by the context.
In the original it says: “and his daughter do not take for your son,
for he will turn away your son”.  Who will turn away?  Of course, the one
to whom the words “his daughter” refer, that is, the father of that daughter.
And in relation to “your son” he is the father-in-law.  So this heathen
father-in-law will turn away his son-in-law — the son of a Jew.  All is simple
and clear.  This is precisely how this passage was explained by one of the most
reasonable rabbis, Rabbenu Tam.

<!-- Unfortunately Rabbenu Tam went further and said that since
“will turn away” is stated only in relation to your son, but not your grandson,
the grandson is not called your son, i.e., a Jew.  In reality the grandson is
not called a Jew only in the case where the heathen father-in-law turned away
the son, and thus the son of the Jew departed from Jewry together with the
grandson.  That is, this is simply a warning that the grandson will depart
from Jewry if they turn away the son.  -->

Nevertheless, for some reason another opinion gained popularity with the absurd
idea of changing the word order of the Torah and swapping the first part with
the second part, so that instead of the Torah's phrase:

> “his daughter do not take for your son, for he will turn away your son”

a new phrase was formed:

> “your daughter do not give to his son, for he will turn away your son”

Such a rearrangement of the words of the Torah completely destroyed the meaning
of the sentence, therefore the words “your son” were also replaced with
“your grandson”.  And as a result, a revised phrase with an entirely different
meaning emerged:

> “your daughter do not give to his son, for he will turn away your grandson”

Such a substitution of “son” with “grandson” violates the laws of logic,
because the familial relationship “father ↔ son” is
[non-transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation):
“son of a son” is not identical to the concept of “son”.
In those places where it is important to mention grandchildren,
this is explicitly indicated.  For example, Shemot
[10:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.10.2): “that you may tell in the hearing
of your son, and of your son's son”, Devarim
[6:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.2): “that you may observe all the
commandments — you, and your son, and your son's son”, etc.  All the more improper
is the substitution of the words “your son” with “son of your daughter”.
<!-- And in general, the case where your son is the son of your daughter looks
like incest, violating the prohibition of consanguineous relations.  -->
Moreover, for the case of the daughter of a Jewess, an additional phrase
“daughter of your daughter” would be required.  And using the word “son” in the
sense of “descendants” is likewise no better.  A son could be called a grandson
only after adoption by the grandfather — in the TaNaKh examples of intrafamilial
adoption are cited, which was widespread in those times.

If one were to allow such an illogical substitution, then the perverted logic
would be as follows: a Jew gave his daughter to an idolater, they had a son,
the idolater turned him away from Judaism, but since he is called
“your son-grandson”, he is considered a Jew.

The argument then continues that “your son-grandson” from a non-Jewish woman is
not called “your son-grandson” but rather “her son”.  But in truth there is
nothing of the sort in the Torah.  And if one does not rearrange the words of
the Torah, then even when using the word “grandson” the meaning remains the
same: “his daughter do not take for your son, for he will turn away your
grandson”.  Since the son of your son is called “your son”, it follows from this
that the son of a non-Jewish woman belongs to the Jewish people.

Then it was pointed out that the words “for she will turn away your son” are
absent.  But the absence of such a phrase indicates only that she will not turn
away your son, because a Jewish son is raised by a Jewish father among Jews.
Therefore the only possible interpretation is this: a Jewish grandson will be
turned away by a heathen grandfather.  That is, on one hand a Jewish grandfather
with a Jewish son and a Jewish grandson, and on the other hand a heathen
grandfather, as the collective image of an entire heathen nation —
one of the seven enumerated nations.

<!-- Here we shall not consider the case where that heathen's wife is Jewish,
as this would complicate matters even further. -->

Also it must be noted that in an analogous situation, grandchildren through
a Jewish son and a non-Jewish mother were called sons of a Jew in Beresheet
[48:5](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.48.5): “And now your two sons are mine”.
Thus spoke Yaakov to Yosef concerning his grandchildren Ephraim and Manasseh,
who were born of a non-Jewish mother.  <!-- And in the book of Ruth, a grandson
through a Jewish father and a Moabite mother was called the son of Naomi. -->

In truth, the phrases in Devarim
[7:3-4](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.3-4) constitute two separate
sentences that represent two different types of cases.  The second part with
“his daughter do not take for your son, for he will turn away your son”
represents a case when a Jewish man brings a non-Jewish wife into his home.
Indeed, in this case a warning is needed, because the upbringing she received
from her idolatrous father may influence the Jewish husband and the Jewish
children.  This is precisely why the same admonition is given in Shemot
[34:16](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.34.16): “And when you take their
daughters for your sons — and they will lead your sons astray”.  The meaning is
only one — a non-Jewish mother can turn away a Jewish son and a Jewish grandson.
But if the son and grandson were not Jewish, then there would be no one to
turn away, and there would be no need to warn.  Therefore in Shemot
[34:16](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.34.16) the law of the Torah is given
concerning the transmission of Jewishness through the paternal line — your
“grandson” from a non-Jewish woman is called “your son”, not “her son”.

On the other hand, the injunction “your daughter do not give to his son”
is an entirely separate case.  To it was not even applicable the warning
“for he will turn away your daughter”, because when a Jewish daughter was given
into a non-Jewish household, she lost all connection with the Jewish people,
and her children could not be Jews, to say nothing of the fact that they had
no possibility of observing Jewish laws and customs among the idolaters.
But the children of a Jewish father and a non-Jewish mother had no such problem,
because they grew up and were raised as Jews in the Jewish community.

Such a type of family arrangement, when spouses live
in the father's household of the husband, is called
[patrilocal residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrilocal_residence).
This arrangement existed for many centuries in Israel and among the surrounding
nations: when Jews took wives from other nations, they lived among the Jews.
But when Jewish women were given into another nation, they were no longer seen,
and their children were not seen either.  For example, when in Beresheet
[46:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.46.7) the lineage of Yaakov is
enumerated, only his sons belonged to his line, grandsons and granddaughters
through his sons, i.e. through the male line, and unmarried daughters.

All the rare examples in the Torah of the opposite type —
[matrilocal residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrilocal_residence)
were unsuccessful.  For example, Yaakov lived among his wives' relatives, therefore
over time he would have assimilated and could not have continued the Jewish lineage,
had he not fled from there in time.  And of Moshe too no memory would have remained,
had he not left his father-in-law's settlement.

Only recently among the Ashkenazim was matrilocal residence customary, therefore
for them there was sense in the inheritance of Jewishness through the mother.

The matrilineal inheritance of Jewishness is incompatible with the tradition
of patrilocality that existed until recently.  When in Bemidbar
[27](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.27) the daughters of Tzelofchad were
permitted to inherit their father's portion, a contradiction arose with the
principle of patrilocality, which created enormous problems requiring additional
restrictions in Bemidbar [36](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.36), and such
women were forbidden to marry Jews from other tribes, so that the women's
inheritance would remain in the father's tribe.  We can imagine that the
daughters of Tzelofchad might have asked not to inherit a land portion, but to
inherit Jewishness through the female line.  This would have created exactly the
same conflict, which would have required analogous restrictions that would have
made it practically impossible for Jewish women to marry non-Jews.
<!-- If as a result of such marriages there had been no possibility of continuing
the lineage, as for example in the case of infertility of crossed hybrids, there
would have been no difference between male or female inheritance. -->

Since the Talmud addresses all manner of questions, in Yevamot
[17a](https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.17a.2) such a question was raised: when
the ten lost tribes were sent into dispersion, did children born of Jewish women
remain Jewish.  And here such a spectacular answer was given: all the women of
these ten tribes suddenly became barren and could not produce offspring — and
that is all, no problem.  No comments.

It is strange to see all these discussions in the Talmud, ignoring the fact
that even in the times of Ezra and Nehemiah it was known that Jewishness is
transmitted through the paternal line.  Neither in Ezra
[9:12](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezra.9.12), nor in Nehemiah
[10:31](https://www.sefaria.org/Nehemiah.10.31), nor in
[13:25](https://www.sefaria.org/Nehemiah.13.25) (which repeat what is said in
Devarim [7:3-4](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.3-4)), is there even
a hint of “is called her son”, on the basis of which the Talmud draws
conclusions opposite to what is said in the Torah.  In Nehemiah
[13:25](https://www.sefaria.org/Nehemiah.13.25) it is even clearly stated why
one must not take their daughters for one's sons, and the example is given of
King Shlomo, who was led into sin by foreign wives.  That is precisely why
those foreign wives who were unwilling to renounce idolatry were sent away — so
that they would not lead their Jewish husbands into sin and would not teach
abominations to the children.  Likewise sent away were those children who had
grown up as idolaters — and this is understandable: in accordance with examples
from the Torah, it would have been right to keep Yaakov and send away Esav.
Therefore they sent away only those who followed pagan abominations,
but no decision was made based on a particular set of chromosomes,
as the Orthodoxes do now.

At the beginning of the book of Ezra, Jewish genealogies by paternal line are
enumerated — by the houses of fathers and by seed.  The mention of seed signifies
that Ezra himself held that Jewishness is transmitted through seed by the male
line, yet nevertheless the seed must not be mingled in accordance with the
requirements of Devarim [7:3-4](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.3-4),
for this would turn away the Jews, i.e., seduce them to follow pagan customs.

<!-- The Book of Ezra clearly narrates what the problem was — the people of
Yisrael, the priests and the Levites took daughters of the forbidden nations as
wives for themselves and for their sons, and mingled the holy seed with these
nations, and followed their abominations.  That is, they took foreign daughters
as wives for themselves, then from the non-Jewish wives were born to them sons
who were Jews, and then they took foreign daughters as wives for their sons, and
thus the priests mingled the holy seed and turned away.  That is, as a result of
the mingling the seed remained Jewish, but with admixtures of foreign cultures. -->

And then the people assembled, and Shecaniah son of Jehiel of the descendants of Elam
<!-- who by what is written was himself the son of a non-Jewish woman, and
married a non-Jewish woman, but their daughter was considered Jewish -->
repented that they had settled foreign wives, and proposed to send away these
wives and children.  <!-- Moreover, to indicate their parents the possessive pronoun
of masculine gender was used — the children of certain men.
Thus, children born of non-Jewish men, as indicated by the masculine plural
pronoun — evidently meaning those born of a marriage between a non-Jewish man
and a Jewish woman.  (For Shecaniah could not have proposed to expel himself.)
This enumeration corresponds to two warnings of the Torah: do not take
non-Jewish wives — therefore send them away, and do not give your daughters
in marriage to non-Jews — therefore send away their children. -->

And then Ezra said: “Acknowledge your guilt before the L‑rd G‑d of your
**fathers** and separate yourselves from the foreign wives”.  But he said nothing
about the children, because he knew that Jewishness is transmitted through the
father.  And the priests obligated themselves to send away their wives.  But
whether they also sent away the children of these wives is not stated.  It is
only said that among the foreign wives there were wives who had borne sons.
This may mean that they came already with their own children from previous
marriages, i.e., what they came with, they left with.  Or perhaps they first
left, and then returned to their Jewish husbands, as it is said in Nehemiah
[13:23](https://www.sefaria.org/Nehemiah.13.23).

In any case, these were not ethnic cleansings, as currently practiced by
Orthodoxes toward Jews by father based solely on genetic heredity, but rather
a separation from the customs of pagan nations: on the one hand, proselytes
from other nations who had turned away from impurity were accepted (Ezra
[6:21](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezra.6.21), Nehemiah
[10:29](https://www.sefaria.org/Nehemiah.10.29)), but on the other hand,
those who followed abominations were sent away, and accordingly,
did not consider themselves Jews.  As it is said in Nehemiah
[13:1](https://www.sefaria.org/Nehemiah.13.1), that they found written in
the book of Moshe, that an Ammonite and a Moabite shall never enter into the
congregation of G‑d (Devarim [23:4](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.23.4)).
Therefore Jewish men had to divorce their Ammonite and Moabite wives.

Yehuda Halevi explained plainly in his book
*[Kuzari](https://www.sefaria.org/Kuzari.3.63)*
that Jewish husbands divorced the mothers of their children.  THEIR CHILDREN!
<!-- *imot bneyhem* -->
That is, called **his** son, not **her** son.  This means that even
in the 12th century it was known that the children of Jewish men are considered Jews.
<!-- In *[Kuzari](https://www.sefaria.org/Kuzari.1.95)* he also teaches
that the connection with G‑d is transmitted from grandfather to grandson. -->

All this shows that the reference to the Book of Ezra for justifying changes in
the definition of Jewishness has no foundation.  Nowhere in the Book of Ezra is
there even a hint that Jewishness is transmitted through the mother.  If the
principle of matrilocal settlement had prevailed in those times, and there had
been such a situation that Jewish women had taken non-Jewish husbands, all the
more so would those non-Jews have been sent away together with their children.
But even if there were proof here, it is clearly stated in the very same Talmud
that the books of Ketuvim cannot serve as a basis for establishing law.
Therefore in any case, the reference to the Book of Ezra confirms nothing and
proves nothing.  And to reject Jews of paternal lineage was forbidden by the
prophets, as is said in the Book of Yirmeyahu:

> I will not reject all the seed of Israel
(Yirmeyahu [31:36](https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.31.36))

But the Orthodoxes reject the seed of Israel.

As much as the disputants in the Talmud tried, they were unable to abolish the
commandment of circumcision for Jews by father.  The only question discussed by
the Talmudists was whether circumcision may be performed on the Sabbath, or
whether the circumcision of a Jew's son should be postponed until the beginning
of the week.  That is, the very fact that a Jew by father needs to be
circumcised is not disputed.  The logic behind the prohibition of circumcision
on the Sabbath is as follows: if a son is born of a lawful marriage, then
violating the Sabbath for his circumcision is justified.  But if the marriage of
a Jew to a woman from the forbidden nations is not considered lawful, then their
son is not considered legitimate, therefore it would be sacrilege to violate the
Sabbath for his circumcision.  Circumcision must still be performed for all
*yeled bayit*, that is, those born of a Jew, but not on the Sabbath —
the circumcision must be postponed to another day.
<!-- as the Karaites do for everyone -->
Because the most important commandment in Beresheet
[17:12-13](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.17.12-13) requires circumcising him
who is born in your house and him who is bought with money of any foreigner
who is not of your seed.  But the Orthodoxes violate this commandment when they
refuse to circumcise zera Yisrael.

The Shulchan Arukh in Yoreh De'ah
[266:13](https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.266.13) states that
a child born to a Jewish father and a non-Jewish mother is not circumcised on
the Sabbath.  This means that on other days one must circumcise him as a Jew.
The general rule is that if circumcision is not urgent, it may be postponed
until the conclusion of the Sabbath.  The same passage states that if for
medical reasons it is impossible to perform the circumcision immediately on the
eighth day, then when such a possibility arises, it is forbidden to violate the
Sabbath, because the appointed time has already been missed.  The same logic
applies to the circumcision of Jews by paternal descent.

It is also noteworthy that in the very same Shulchan Arukh
Yoreh De'ah [241:9](https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.241.9)
it is stated that a ger is the son of an *oved kokhavim*
(literally: “worshipper of stars”), i.e., the son of an idolater.
But despite this, the ger is forbidden to curse his father.
In Kitzur Shulchan Arukh [143](https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Arukh.143.22)
instead of the word “idolater” it is stated that a ger is the son
of a non-Jew, and he is forbidden to curse his father.
Here it is evident that such a situation was considered impossible,
when the son of a Jew undergoes conversion.

This indicates that in the Middle Ages, children of a Jewish father were
considered Jews.  And only recently did the persecution and discrimination
of Jews through the father begin.

Thus did the Orthodoxes transform the righteous commandment against assimilation
into an instrument for punishing the descendants of fathers who sinned, but not
mothers who sinned.  When the Orthodoxes punish descendants for the sins of
ancestors, they thereby take upon themselves the prerogative of G‑d, for it is
written in the Torah that only G‑d may punish the children and grandchildren of
Jews, but only those who hate Him.

But even Shulchan Arukh Even HaEzer
[16](https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Even_HaEzer.16.1)
based on Hilkhot Issurei Biah
[12](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Forbidden_Intercourse.12.1) makes
no distinction between cases of marriage between a Jewish man and a non-Jewish
woman and marriage between a Jewish woman and a non-Jewish man.  In both cases
the beit-din punishes them with lashes for violating the law of the Torah given
in Devarim [7:3-4](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.3-4).

Yet at the present time the Orthodoxes have added punishment of children from
the marriage of a Jewish man and a non-Jewish woman, but have abolished the
punishment by lashes of their parents, and have abolished the punishment of
children from the marriage of a Jewish woman and a non-Jewish man — such
a marriage no longer has any consequences: children from such a marriage do not
suffer from discrimination, they are no longer considered either gentiles or
mamzerim.  And now in fact the Orthodoxes encourage mixed marriages, encourage
Jewish women to marry non-Jews, because Jewish women can marry non-Jews
without facing consequences for themselves and for their children:
their children do not suffer, since the Orthodoxes do not punish the children of
a Jewish woman from a non-Jew, despite the fact that the mother is no less guilty
in increasing the number of mixed marriages, and thus the Orthodoxes encourage
assimilation.

But it was not always so.  Before the destruction of the Second Temple, children
of a Jewish woman and a non-Jewish man were considered non-Jews.  And for a long
time after the destruction of the Second Temple, children of a Jewish woman and
a non-Jewish man were considered mamzerim.  <!-- And now all Orthodoxes born
in marriage without chuppah may be considered mamzerim.  -->

First, we could explore what interpretation was prevalent in the early Talmudic
period for the following passage of the Torah, where “the son of an Israelite
woman” is contrasted with “the children of Israel”:

> And there went out a son of an Israelite woman, who was also the son of
an Egyptian man, among the children of Israel, and in the camp the son of the
Israelite woman quarreled with an Israelite man.  And the son of the Israelite
woman blasphemed and cursed the name of G‑d, and they brought him to Moshe,
and his mother's name was Shelomit, daughter of Divri of the tribe of Dan
(Vayikra [24:10-11](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.24.10-11))

The halakhic Midrash Sifra (*Torat Kohanim*), frequently cited in the Talmud,
provides in [14:1](https://www.sefaria.org/Sifra,_Emor,_Section_14.1) such an
explanation that the phrase “among the children of Israel” teaches that the son
of the Egyptian became a proselyte, i.e., the son of the Jewish woman underwent
conversion in order to join the people of Israel.

The greatest medieval commentator
[Rashi](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.24.10?with=Rashi)
in his commentary quoted these same words without change.
And Rashi is absolutely correct.  Notwithstanding that the son
of the Egyptian father had a Jewish mother, he required conversion,
because formerly Jewishness was transmitted only through the paternal line.
Precisely the same commentary was left by another authoritative commentator
[Ibn Ezra](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.24.10?with=Ibn%20Ezra).

Here arises the question of why many Orthodoxes continue to assert that this
son of an Egyptian was a Jew by birth, and that Jewishness through the mother
has been transmitted since the patriarchs, despite the fact that it is clearly
stated that the son of a non-Jew was not recognized as a Jew.  Why can not
the Orthodoxes themselves agree among themselves about the moment
when the maternal determination was invented.
Why do some assert that it began with Sarah, others — that it began at Sinai,
yet others — that it was after the settlement in Israel (citing the words
“When the L‑rd, your G‑d, brings you into the land you are going to”,
i.e., forty years after Sinai), etc.
These questions are rhetorical, because it is historically established that
the question of maternal transmission began to be discussed only after the
destruction of the Second Temple.

> and they took the blasphemer outside the camp, and pelted him with stones
(Vayikra [24:23](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.24.23))

This teaches that Jewishness through the mother brings many problems.
<!-- In Devarim [13:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.13.7)
the danger of sons turning away through their mothers is especially emphasized. -->
It is noteworthy that the Torah emphasizes that only a Jew through the mother
could permit himself such blasphemy (*chillul HaShem*), because in
those times the son's education was the responsibility of the father.
<!-- While the mother mainly worked in the household. -->
Among the Jews in all times, a son was taught Torah by his father,
but not by his mother,
<!-- Kiddushin [29a:10](https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.29a.10),
[29b:8-10](https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.29b.8-10), Shulchan Arukh
Yoreh De'ah [245:1](https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.245.1) -->
and women were altogether forbidden to study Torah.
<!-- For example, Sotah [21b](https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.21b.1):
“He who teaches his daughter Torah teaches her licentiousness”. -->
But the Egyptian father instilled in his son antisemitism
and hatred against everything Jewish.

Therefore a Jew by father is incapable of such sacrilege.
And indeed, I know examples when Jews by mother reviled rabbis
in every way, showered rabbis with such demeaning insults,
<!-- very telling example of how rabbis are punished for their errors -->
sending them to various places, that I was even ashamed to hear such things,
because I regard rabbis with enormous respect, despite all
the suffering they caused me.  And yet such Jews by mother,
despite their immoral behavior, enjoyed the respect of rabbis,
while rabbis cast me out.
<!-- But still, unlike the son of the Egyptian, Jews by mother did not
insult the name of G‑d — only because they were atheists.  Formerly atheists were
cast out of the community, but now they accept everyone — except Jews by father.
Though many by mother have nothing Jewish at all. -->

One of the confirmations that a son is raised by the father is brought
in Pesachim [49](https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.49a.12).
The sages taught that a man should strive to take as wife the daughter of
a Torah scholar, but under no circumstances the daughter of an *am ha‑aretz*
(here this is a synonym for ignoramus).  For if the children lose their father,
then the mother will undertake the education of the children, and then it depends
solely upon her what heritage she will transmit to the child: either upbringing
as a Torah scholar, or as an *am ha‑aretz*.  This is also one of the reasons
for attempts to transition to matrilineality, when many Jewish children
had no fathers, and their upbringing came to be undertaken by mothers.

Yet another proof of the transmission of Jewishness through the father line
can be found in Shemot 1:

> And Pharaoh said: when you deliver the Jewish women, look at who is born:
if it is a boy — kill him, if it is a girl — let her live
(Shemot [1:16](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.1.16))

> And Pharaoh commanded all his people: Every newborn boy you
shall cast into the river, but every girl you shall keep alive
(Shemot [1:22](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.1.22))

Here it is evident that only the boys were subject to extermination — when men
could not transmit Jewishness to their children, the number of Jews diminished.
But Jewish women posed no threat to Pharaoh, because when Egyptians took Jewish
women as wives, their children became Egyptians, increasing the number of
Egyptians.

In general, the story described in Vayikra 24 began when a certain Egyptian took
a Jewish maidservant as his wife, they dwelt among the Egyptians, and a son was
born to them.  As some commentators suppose, this Egyptian was slain by Moshe
when the Egyptian was beating another Jewish.  After the Egyptian's son lost
his father, he returned to Jews together with his mother, and when the Exodus
began, they went forth together with all.  To be counted as a Jew, he needed
to undergo conversion.  After conversion he became part of *erev rav*
(the mixed multitude) — part of the mixed marriages whose fathers were Egyptians
and whose mothers were Jewish women who had been enslaved by the Egyptians.
But Jews through the father had no such problem, because Jews by paternal lineage
retained their affiliation with their tribe.

The situation then unfolded as follows: a proselyte from the camp of *erev rav*
came to the camp of bnei Yisrael, i.e. <!-- *ezrachim* --> the native
inhabitants, and attempted to pitch his tent in the camp of his mother in the
tribe of Dan.  But the Israelites from the tribe of Dan told him that after
undergoing conversion his father is considered to be Avraham, and not the
progenitor of the tribe of Dan.  For this reason they refused him — because
affiliation with a tribe is determined not by the mother, but only by the
father:

> Take a census of the entire congregation of the children of Israel
by their families, by their fathers' houses.
(Bemidbar [1:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.1.2))

> And they declared their pedigrees after their families, by their fathers' houses
(Bemidbar [1:18](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.1.18))

> Each shall camp by his own banner, with the emblems of their ancestral houses;
the children of Israel shall encamp
(Bemidbar [2:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.2.2))

Therefore in Bava Batra [109b](https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.109b.5)
it is said that the family of the father is a family, but the family of the
mother is not a family, i.e., genealogy is traced only through the paternal line.

But an Egyptian on his father's side after conversion sought to change
his ancestral house <!-- *beit avotam* --> to his mother's house,
but could not do so, as explained in
Vayikra Rabbah [32:3](https://www.sefaria.org/Vayikra_Rabbah.32.3).

Also:

> divide the land according to your ancestral tribes
(Bemidbar [33:54](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.33.54))

> that your days and the days of your children may be prolonged upon the land
which G‑d swore to give to your fathers
(Devarim [11:21](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11.21))

And the words:

> according to the names of their ancestral tribes shall they inherit
(Bemidbar [26:55](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.26.55))

Sifrei Bemidbar [132](https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Bamidbar.132) comments
in such a way that proselytes are excluded, i.e. Jews by mother
whose father is not Jewish.

This means that while the tribes existed, Jewish identity was transmitted
through the father, and all non-Jews who were not *mi‑zarakha*, who were not of
the seed through the paternal line, had to undergo conversion.  Moreover, the
case with the Egyptian showed that transmission of Jewish identity through the
mother was too problematic.

It should be acknowledged that in the blasphemy of the son of a Jewish woman,
there is also guilt on the part of those who expelled him from the camp of Dan,
and brought him to such a desperate state that he could not control himself and
broke into cursing.  And now those who are Jewish through their father find
themselves in the same rejected position.  Many examples are known of a Jewish
person through the paternal line who regarded the Orthodoxes favorably, but
they rejected him, and after this that person lost his Jewish moral bearings,
became a moral degenerate, and even an antisemite like Amalek.
Sanhedrin [99b](https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.99b.8) reports that Amalek
descended from Timna.  Timna came to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to undergo
conversion, but they did not accept her.  As a result, Amalek was born,
who hated the Jews.

Here no examples will be given of how low Jews by patrilineal descent sank when
Orthodoxes drove them out to the idolaters.  This does not apply to me — I know
with certainty that I am Jewish, because G‑d counts me as a Jew and requires me
to observe the commandments.
<!-- And there is no such anti-conversion that could make me a non-Jew. -->
But this danger threatens those Jews by patrilineal descent who yield to
pressure from Orthodoxes taking away their Jewishness.  Therefore, in this
passage the Torah gives a lesson that one must relate with understanding and
benevolence to those of mixed descent who wish to be part of the Jewish people.
But Orthodoxes reject this teaching, and thereby make the world worse.
First they destroyed the Temple through baseless hatred, and now
they destroy the world as well — instead of repairing it.

In tractate Beitzah [32b](https://www.sefaria.org/Beitzah.32b.4), an incident is
recounted in which one Jew found himself in dire straits and asked a prosperous
Jewish community to help him with sustenance and work, but he was refused aid.
And then this unfortunate person cried out that those wealthy people were
unworthy to be called descendants of Abraham, because they lacked the compassion
and mercy inherent to Jews.  Instead, they showed themselves to be heirs of the
*erev rav*.  And this reproach applies equally to contemporary Orthodoxes,
who demonstrate an absence of compassion and mercy, forgetting the fundamental
principles of Judaism.

In Yevamot [79a](https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.79a.3)
it is stated that three distinguishing marks are inherent in the Jewish people:

1. compassion, mercy —
   “and granted you compassion, and made you merciful”
   (Devarim [13:18](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.13.18));
2. conscientiousness —
   “that fear of Him may be upon your faces”
   (Shemot [20:17](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.17));
3. striving to do good deeds —
   “to follow the ways of G‑d, doing good”
   (Beresheet [18:19](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.18.19)).

Only one possessing all these characteristics can be considered a Jew.  It is
further said that it is better for a letter to be torn from the Torah than for
the Heavenly Name to be profaned publicly.  And when Orthodoxes consider it
their sacred duty to terrorize Jews by paternal lineage, using the Torah
to justify their actions, this is the very essence of the desecration
of the Name of the Most High — *chillul HaShem*.

Besides the proof of transmission of Jewish identity through the father's house,
the determination of Jewish identity through the father is also indicated by the
fact how the words “G‑d of our fathers” and “G‑d of my fathers” are recited
in all prayers.  This confirms the fact that Jewish identity was transmitted
through the paternal line until the time of the completion of the prayer texts'
composition.  And only beginning from the second century C.E. did the rabbis
change the definition of Jewish identity from the paternal line to the maternal,
taking Roman law as their basis.  This change occurred over a long period of
time and passed unnoticed, because it did not concern the majority of Jews,
when contacts with surrounding nations were minimized and accordingly there
were no mixed marriages.  But a renewal of the prayer would have been noticed
by all Jews.

When a Jew only through the mother says “G‑d of my father”, he refers to his
idolatrous father, and this is already paganism.  Therefore in this case
a conversion would be needed, so that the non-Jewish father would be replaced
by Avraham Avinu.  But even in this case they cannot mention Yitzchak and Yaakov
as fathers — Yitzchak and Yaakov are in a different genealogical line of
descendants, when only Avraham is considered the father of converts.

And now such an absurdity has been adopted, that when a person is Jewish through
the paternal line, he is required to undergo conversion with the replacement of
his Jewish father with Avraham, which makes no sense at all — why should he
renounce his father when his father is Jewish.  It would be more consistent
if Jews only through the mother would say not *avotai* and not *avoteinu*,
but *avoteihem* — “their fathers”.

But I have no such problem.  When I recite this prayer, I envision all my
fathers, the entire paternal line going back to Avraham.  When I prayed in
the synagogue, I would imagine them all sitting in the prayer hall — all 120
ancestors in the paternal line: the Patriarchs at the very beginning, the closer
ancestors at the back of the hall, and at the edge myself — a Jew of the 120th
generation, counting from Avraham Avinu.

Therefore I deeply sympathize with Jews only through the maternal line, for whom
such a problem exists.  I cannot imagine what they feel when reciting this
prayer.  To eliminate their discrimination, it should be permitted to add
mentions of the Matriarchs to the prayer — *imoteinu* Sarah, Rivkah, Rachel, Leah.

Generally, the history of discussions on this topic revolves around the
following Torah passages concerning the festive bringing of *bikkurim*
(first fruits):

> “I have entered the land which G‑d swore unto our fathers to give us”
(Devarim [26:3](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.26.3))

> and rejoice in all the good which the L‑rd your G‑d has given you and
your house, you, and the Levite, and the stranger that is in your midst
(Devarim [26:11](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.26.11))

In his commentary on this passage
[Rashi](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.26.11?with=Rashi)
notes that a stranger (*ger*, i.e. a proselyte) cannot recite
the words that G‑d swore to our fathers, because the father of a proselyte
is by definition a non‑Jew.  This is yet another proof that the Torah
teaches that Jewishness is transmitted through the father: descendants of Jews
through the paternal line do not require conversion — patrilineal Jews can say
“to our fathers”.

In this commentary, Rashi references the Mishnah Bikkurim
[1:4](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Bikkurim.1.4), where it states that
a proselyte does not recite the words “to our fathers”.  But if the
proselyte's mother is Jewish, then he does recite them.  This again
confirms that Jews through the mother underwent conversion.

The Mishnah further specifies that in individual prayer a proselyte says:
“G‑d of the fathers of Israel”, but when praying in the synagogue, says:
“G‑d of your fathers”, and when a proselyte's mother is Jewish, he may say:
“G‑d of our fathers”.  Nevertheless, a problem remains: even when a proselyte's
mother is Jewish, he cannot say “the land which You swore to give us”,
because converts had no portion in the land of Israel.

Later Rambam noted that the halakhah existing at that time contradicted the
Mishnah, because according to Rabbi Yehudah's proposal it was accepted that any
proselyte may say “to our fathers”, since when a proselyte has a non-Jewish
father, the proselyte receives a new father — Avraham, and then the words
“to our fathers” refer to the Patriarch.  And the words “swore to give us the land”
refer to messianic times, when gerim will receive their portion in Israel.
In short, the rabbis extricated themselves from a difficult position and devised
justifications — they can when they want to.  So what prevents them now
from doing the same and easing the fate of Jews by father?

In the tractate Kiddushin it is claimed that status is inherited through the
father if there are no violations (in the betrothal), or through the defective
parent otherwise (i.e., among nations that have no betrothal traditions).
Consequently, when a Jewish woman has a non-Jewish husband, nationality passes
through the “incorrect” parent, i.e., through the father, so the children
are not Jewish.  The son of a Jewish woman is not a Jew because in the case of
a forbidden union between a Jewish woman and a non-Jew, the status of the
“incorrect” parent is inherited, namely that of the non-Jewish father.
But even this law was later abolished.

In Mishneh Torah Yibbum va‑Chalitzah
[4:5](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Levirate_Marriage_and_Release.4.5)
(levirate marriage and chalitzah), in accordance with Yevamot
[102a](https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.102a.3), the children of a convert and
a Jewish woman are not considered Jews at all, of whom it could be said in the
words of Devarim [25:10](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.25.10): “And his
name shall be called in Israel”.  Therefore they are forbidden to participate
in the ceremony of chalitzah.  On the other hand, in Shulchan Arukh Even HaEzer
[169](https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Even_HaEzer.169.2), the opinion is
brought that one whose father is Jewish may participate in the ceremony, i.e.,
he is considered Jewish through his father.

Regarding the passage about the son of the Egyptian, Sifra also provides an
explanation that he was treated as a mamzer.  And this is indeed a terrible status.
<!-- And the Book of Jubilees [30](https://www.sefaria.org/Book_of_Jubilees.30.11-12)
actually instructs to burn Jewish women who marry non-Jews. -->

In the Mishnah (Yevamot [7:5](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yevamot.7.5))
and in many places in the Talmud (e.g., Yevamot
[46a](https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.46a.16)), it is unequivocally stated that
the children of a Jewish woman and a non-Jewish man are mamzerim.  Moreover, one
of the rabbis who declared this was that very Rabbi Yochanan who proposed
abolishing Jewishness through the father.  But just as his opinion regarding
mamzerim was rejected, so too must the opinion discriminating against Jews
through the father be rejected, and the determination of Jewishness through
the paternal line must be restored.

By the way, Rabbi Yochanan said many other interesting things: for example, in
Megillah [13a](https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.13a.2) he said that anyone who
rejects idolatry is called a Jew — a very bold statement, opening great possibilities.
<!-- The same is confirmed in the midrashim Sifrei Devarim
[54:4](https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Devarim.54.4)
and Lekach Tov on Megillat Esther
[2:5](https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.2.5?with=Midrash%20Lekach%20Tov). -->

<!-- Another telling example of the sages' level of wisdom:
the same Rabbi Yochanan, citing Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai in Sotah
[12b](https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.12b.2), asserted that in Shemot
[2:5](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.2.5) Pharaoh's daughter came to the
river to immerse herself for the completion of the conversion process. -->

In his commentary on the tractate Kiddushin
[68b](https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Kiddushin.68b.4.2), Rashi proposed the
following idea: to eliminate all doubts, one should perform conversion for the
children of a Jewish woman just in case, so that they would not be considered
either gentiles or mamzerim.  However, in the Shulchan Arukh, Rashi's opinion
was ignored, and instead it was decided that the simplest solution was to
recognize the children of a Jewish woman and a non-Jewish man as full-blooded
Jews rather than mamzerim.  Thus, quite recently, the problem of matrilineal
Jews was resolved so simply.  They went ahead and abolished the previous laws
of halakhah.  Just as they abolished mamzerim through the mother, they should
likewise abolish the discrimination against Jews through the paternal line.

All the above confirms the following indisputable fact: that the determination
of Jewishness through the paternal line is a law of the Torah (*de'oraita*),
while through the maternal line it is a rabbinic enactment (*derabanan*).

Jews by father are Jews according to Torah, by mother — Jews according to Halakhah.

<!-- Once more regarding the transmission of Jewishness:
a truth established and earned through my sufferings: -->

**BY THE FATHER — DE‑ORAITA — LAW OF THE TORAH**

**BY THE MOTHER — DE‑RABBANAN — LAW OF THE SAGES**

Through the father — peshat, through the mother — derash.
But derash does not nullify peshat
(Shabbat [63a](https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.63a.14)).
Therefore a Jew is one who is either a patrilineal descendant of a Jew,
or a matrilineal descendant of a Jewess, or both.
This equitable principle is called ‘equilineal descent’.
Such equality prevents discrimination against descendants of
either Jewish women or Jewish men.
<!--
cf [ambilineality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambilineality)
-->
Not for nothing was this principle of gender egalitarianism proclaimed by the
great sage Shlomo in Proverbs, where the father's instruction is equal with the
mother's teaching (Mishlei [1:8](https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.1.8)
and [6:20](https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.6.20)).
The father's instruction is the Written Torah, according to which Jewishness
is transmitted through the father.  And the mother's teaching is the Oral Torah,
where it is reversed.

After the destruction of the Temple and the abolition of the Sanhedrin, the laws
of the Torah continued to change through authoritarian decisions that lacked
juridical foundation.  Among these was a change to the Torah law establishing
Jewishness through the father, so that lineage could be determined unambiguously
— in most cases it was known with certainty who a child's mother was, but the
father was not always known.  Therefore, the abandonment of transmitting
Jewishness through the father was nothing other than yet another “fence around
the Torah”: lest a person should accidentally slip in among the Jews whose
unidentified father was not actually Jewish.

The main reason why after the destruction of the Second Temple the
determination of Jewishness through the mother was adopted — the possibility of
precisely establishing the child's mother, whereas establishing the father's
identity was difficult.

Previously, paternity could be reliably established only for renowned fathers.
For example, in Yevamot [37b](https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.37b.6)
a custom is described whereby well-known rabbis would briefly travel away
from their wives on business, and there temporarily marry local women for a day.
Now, the children of these women were considered legitimate offspring of the
rabbinical fathers, because it was known to all that they were the fathers of
these children.

But in truth, as the stories of the TaNaKh teach, even the mother of a child
cannot always be established with absolute certainty.  The most instructive
story is found in Melakhim I [3:16-28](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.3.16-28),
when two women appeared before King Shlomo's court claiming to be the mother of
one child.  And only the great wisdom of King Shlomo helped resolve this dispute.
And in our day such a possibility remains, when infants can be mixed up
in the maternity ward.

Just as there were formerly doubts about the time of the new month's arrival,
and therefore additional festival days were added in the diaspora, at present
the possibility of precise determination of calendar dates has emerged, and
therefore the need for such a safeguard has fallen away.

Similarly, at present it has become possible to determine
Jewish ancestry with 100% accuracy by means of genealogical
[DNA tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogical_DNA_test).
Such genetic tests make it possible to establish not only all Jewish ancestors,
but also what percentage of Jewish genes they passed on to their descendants.

Therefore, to fully confirm my Jewish ancestry, I successfully underwent
a [genetic test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_genomics),
and as a result received confirmation that my ancestors were *Ashkenazi Jewish*.
<!-- By the way, recently hackers broke into a website with genetic test results
and published genetic information from a million accounts of Ashkenazi Jews. -->
Moreover, my genetic tests showed that
the [Y-chromosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-chromosomal_Aaron)
I inherited through the paternal line
originates from a typically Jewish
[haplogroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-DNA_haplogroups_by_ethnic_group).

This means that on my paternal line my direct ancestor is Avraham-avinu,
that is, I have exactly the same Y-chromosome as Avraham had, transmitted from him
unchanged through all 120 generations.  It is no wonder that the Torah defines
Jewishness through the paternal line, because the Y-chromosome is transmitted
precisely through the father.

If we assume the hypothesis that Jewishness is genetically transmitted through
the mother via the X-chromosome, then it is necessary to take into account the
fact that the [X-chromosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome) is
present in both women and men.  This would mean that Jewishness is also
transmitted through the father.  If we further assume that one Jewish soul is
inherited from the mother through the X-chromosome, and another Jewish soul is
inherited from the father also through the X-chromosome, then this leads to
a contradiction, for a person cannot have two Jewish souls simultaneously:
one from the mother and one from the father.  From this follows the conclusion
that genetically, Jewishness cannot be transmitted from the mother through the
X-chromosome.  Jewishness is transmitted from father to son, because only men
possess the [Y-chromosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome).

The only hereditary material transmitted primarily from the mother is
[mitochondrial DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA).
But unlike the main genome, which is located in the cell nucleus, the
mitochondrial DNA genome is found in tiny organelles outside the cell nucleus
and contains auxiliary genes (only 37 genes compared to 20,000 main genes,
i.e., just 0.1%).  Therefore, to assert the transmission of Jewishness through
insignificant mitochondrial DNA is akin to wishing on Rosh HaShanah to be
at the tail rather than at the head.
<!-- If one imagines humanity's development as the movement of a train
with many cars, then the Orthodoxes prefer to ride in the last car
(based on a statement from the film
*[Yoel, Israel and Pashkavils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoel,_Israel_&_Pashkavils)*),
while the non-Orthodoxes ride in the locomotive at the front. -->

Almost 10 years ago, scientists introduced a method for
[replacing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_replacement_therapy)
defective mitochondria from a mother affected by genetic diseases using healthy
mitochondria from a donor.  If one follows the assertions of the Orthodoxes,
the result would be such absurdity that the Jewish soul is transmitted from
the mitochondrial donor, who has no relation whatsoever to the parents' genes.

When Orthodoxes conduct mitochondrial DNA tests,
they must invent some unknown Ashkenazi foremothers.  Due to the
[bottleneck effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews#Genetics),
all Ashkenazim descended from only four women who lived in Europe 1000 years ago and
were not Jewish at all.  It is unsurprising that the four Ashkenazi foremothers
were non-Jewish, because in all ages Jews often married non-Jewish women,
breaking the line of mitochondrial DNA inheritance.  Therefore, if one attempts
to construct a maternal genealogical tree parallel to the Torah's paternal tree,
it will be impossible to trace a line from any Jew ascending to the Biblical
matriarchs.  The existence of such a concept as
[Mitochondrial Sarah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_Eve)
is impossible.

The Jewish genealogical tree is built through the paternal line, therefore we
can say that all Jews descended from Avraham.  But one cannot say that through
the maternal line Jews descended from Sarah, because it is impossible to
construct such a Jewish genealogical tree through the maternal line, impossible
to trace the lineage through the direct female line to a common ancestral mother.

While all Jewish men have a Y-chromosome inherited from Avraham, no one has or
could have mitochondrial DNA inherited from Sarah.  Sarah is considered one of
the matriarchs only because she gave birth to one of the patriarchs, Yitzchak.
This once again proves that Jewishness is transmitted through the father.
Therefore, through the paternal Y-chromosome, all Jews' line of inheritance
ascends to Avraham.  And I have exactly the same Y-chromosome as our
great-great-…-great-forefather Avraham Avinu.
<!-- And I carefully preserve my Jewish chromosome. -->
<!-- Despite the fact that on the maternal line my ancestors are Khazars who accepted Judaism. -->

This explains why those who are Jewish through their father exhibit genetic
characteristics inherent in their Jewish ancestors.  Because the brain develops
according to the genetic program encoded in DNA.  For example, in my case
the genes were distributed so that all the Jewish genes went toward brain
development.  Therefore, thanks to a Jewish brain, I possess a Jewish way of
thinking, a Jewish mentality.

It often happens that for Jews through the mother, Jewish genes
affect only physical appearance, but not the formation of the brain.
And only non-Jewish genes go into the brain.  Then in this case they
have nothing Jewish: neither in worldview, nor in behavior, nor in the
manifestation of *middot* — Jewish qualities, virtues, moral and ethical
values.  But with Jews through the father it is often the opposite, when in
their brain there is nothing non-Jewish, and therefore they are 100% Jews.

<!-- Genetic memory explains why different Jewish traditions were passed down
to me through genes.  Because Jewish genes demanded this be done, and the Jewish
soul is transmitted through Jewish genes from the father. -->

<!-- And all the suffering I endured thanks to the centuries-old experience
of bearing suffering by my Jewish ancestors. -->

When G‑d connects the soul to the brain, the Jewish brain accordingly receives
a Jewish soul.  The complete logical chain looks as follows: Jewish genes create
a Jewish brain → the Jewish brain receives a Jewish soul.

Therefore, a Jew is one whom G‑d considers a Jew and gives a Jewish soul.
And when a person has a Jewish soul, he himself understands that he is a Jew.

If a person feels within themselves a Jewish soul, this means they truly possess
a Jewish soul.  Just as when a person senses within themselves any soul, this
confirms the existence of the soul.  One who denies the existence of a Jewish
soul in a person also denies the existence of the soul altogether, and thereby
becomes equivalent to atheists and materialists.
<!-- Orthodoxes do not help other people, because they believe
that other people have no soul, like
[non-player characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character),
who play auxiliary roles and are incapable of suffering. -->

For example, my brain was formed entirely from Jewish genes, therefore I have
a 100% Jewish brain.  And a Jewish brain automatically receives a Jewish soul.
<!-- When I learned in childhood that I was Jewish, I felt the Jewish soul within me —
I distinctly sensed how an additional Jewish soul sat firmly inside me. -->
<!-- And over time the Jewish part of my personality became dominant -->

The fact that the Jewish soul is transmitted through the paternal chromosome
is confirmed in Yechezkel [18:4](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.18.4):
“As the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son — they are Mine”.

The problem is that due to profound ignorance in the Middle Ages,
matrilineal determination was introduced, because it was believed that the
mother transmits the body to the child, while the father transmits only the
seed. <!-- Soul — through the father, body — through the mother. -->
But after the discoveries of genetics, such a notion lost its meaning.
And now, because of medieval prejudices, many Jews of paternal lineage suffer.
Therefore, following the path of mercy that Torah teaches, contemporary rabbis
must change Halakhah to spare Jews from suffering.

Just as there was a precedent for softening Halakha when Jews by mother
suffered, so too Orthodoxes must have compassion for suffering Jews by father.
The leniency for Jews by mother was made because in most cases one can
reliably establish who a person's mother is, whereas confirmation of paternity
was not absolutely precise.  But now, with the development of genetic technologies,
this presents no problem — one can easily take a genetic test that confirms the
presence of Jewish genes through the paternal line, descending from Avraham-avinu.

The general rule applied by the Jewish sages was this — when a multitude of the
people suffers, the halakha adapts itself to diminish their suffering.  Thus,
the halakha was changed from transmission of Jewishness through the paternal
line to the maternal line, when a multitude of Jews through their mothers
suffered, whose fathers were from the army of the Romans who came to destroy
the Temple.  Conversely, there was no problem of marriages between Jewish men
and non-Jewish women, because in those times so few Jewish men remained that
there was simply no one to take non-Jewish women from the surrounding nations
as wives.

When the percentage of men and women in communities became balanced 1000 years
ago, Rabbi Gershom instituted a 1000-year prohibition on polygamy, despite the
fact that it was permitted by the Written law.  This was one of many precedents
for changing centuries-old laws, and as a result, for example, levirate marriage
lost its meaning in most cases.

The prohibition of polygamy eliminated the discrimination whereby some men had
many wives while others lacked.  This restored justice and established equality
among people.  That same rabbi also eliminated discrimination against women when
he introduced the prohibition against divorcing a wife without her consent, etc.
All these are examples of the category of *chesed*, reducing human suffering.

But, unfortunately, the temporary ruling of earlier rabbis defining Jewishness
solely through the mother has not yet been rescinded.  Laws are forbidden to be
abolished, but it was permitted to temporarily suspend the operation of a law.
Now more than 1,000 years have passed since the adoption of the decree
temporarily suspending the Torah law on the inheritance of Jewishness through
the paternal line.  It is time to rescind this unjust decree, so as to eliminate
the discrimination whereby some halves are welcomed, while others are rejected
with revulsion.

Under this commandment the Orthodoxes understand anything and everything:
both [kidnapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping),
and “theft of knowledge” (*[gneivat da'at](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneivat_da'at)*
from Mekhilta Nezikin [13:14‑15](https://www.sefaria.org/Mekhilta_DeRabbi_Yishmael,_Tractate_Nezikin.13.14-15)),
i.e. deception — as it is said in Shmuel II [15:6](https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.15.6):
“And Avshalom stole the hearts of the people of Israel”.

<!-- I became convinced of the necessity of understanding this commandment
according to peshat in childhood.  Once as a child I was persuaded to go eat
strawberries in someone else's strawberry field.  In this case the permission of
Devarim [23:25-26](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.23.25-26) to eat grapes
to satiety in another's vineyard and to pluck as many ears of grain as one
wishes in another's grain field does not apply, because that permission applies
only to hired strawberry pickers, which parallels the requirement of Devarim
[25:4](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.25.4) not to muzzle an ox.

Thus, when no one was watching, we carried out a raid and quickly gathered
full handfuls of strawberries.  Then we hid in a secluded spot
and began consuming the stolen food.  But the strawberries would not go down!
And then we started spitting the strawberries at each other and stained all our clothes.
And afterward, the stains long served as a reproach for committing this unseemly
deed.  Thus from early childhood I learned that theft brings no joy. -->

In general, everything except the most important thing — whereas the biggest
problem lies in the fact that the Orthodoxes commit with impunity such
a devastating form of theft as IDENTITY THEFT (not the same as
[identity fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_fraud)).

The Orthodoxes steal identity from Jews by the paternal line — and thereby
destroy people's lives.  Without Jewish identity, people are doomed to endless
suffering, because in this criminal way they are deprived of the meaning of life.

In precisely the same way that Communist antisemites in the Soviet Union
stripped all Jews of their identity, turning them into
“[rootless cosmopolitans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootless_cosmopolitan)”,
now the Orthodoxes strip Jews by patrilineal descent of their identity.

Just as antisemites in the Soviet Union destroyed the lives and fates of Jews,
placing all manner of obstacles in their education, refusing them admission to
universities, and at work, impeding their career advancement, so too do the
Orthodoxes destroy the lives of patrilineal Jews.

Worse yet, when Orthodoxes terrorize patrilineal Jews,
they employ such methods of psychological pressure as
*[gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting)*.

Midrash Sifra Kedoshim [2:14](https://www.sefaria.org/Sifra,_Kedoshim,_Section_2.14)
explains that this commandment *lifnei iver lo titen mikhshol*
enjoins against giving unfavorable advice that misleads and directs
a person along a false path that causes them harm.

For example, the Orthodoxes in Israel didn't advise me to make aliyah,
despite the fact that I have the right to repatriation (the word “repatriation”
literally means returning to the land of my fathers) in accordance with the
[Law of Return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Return),
i.e., the Orthodoxes concealed this possibility from me — thereby placing before
me an obstacle that destroyed my life.  And then, time and again, instead of
helping, they continued to place obstacles, without fearing G‑d.  <!-- Just as
the satan places obstacles. -->  First they pushed me out of Israel, insisting
that I was not needed in Israel.  And then, outside Israel, Orthodox rabbis,
in order to rid themselves of me, did the opposite — they advised me to go to
Israel, promising that I would be accepted there, i.e., the rabbis degraded
themselves into outright lies.

<!-- It is clear that Satan hardened the hearts of the Orthodoxes so that they
would treat me mercilessly — and thereby violate the commandments.  And Satan also
compelled me to participate in tests of the Orthodoxes.  For example, thus Satan
made the rabbi drive me out in disgrace like Bar Kamtza.  I was at the evening
prayer, and after prayer everyone walked through the city streets to the rabbi's
home.  I suspected that I would be an unwelcome guest, so I tried to seize
a convenient moment and quietly slip away.  But my friends were so happy to
talk with me and kept talking without stopping, that it would have been very
discourteous for me to interrupt the conversation and bid farewell.  I planned
to leave unnoticed when everyone would be entering the rabbi's building.  But
already halfway there the rabbi looked back, saw me, approached and loudly and
publicly rebuked me, saying that he did not wish to see non-Jews at his place,
and that I must leave immediately right there on the street.  But this could
have been done in a less humiliating manner.  For example, he could have called
me aside and informed me of the same thing in a whisper, so as not to shame me
like Bar Kamtza, on account of whom the Temple was destroyed.  Satan sent trials
to the Orthodoxes, but the Orthodoxes did not cope with the ordeals, did not
pass Satan's tests and violated the commandments of the Torah.  -->

According to the plain meaning of this commandment, if a person of Jewish
descent wishes to serve G‑d in accordance with Jewish traditions, but finds
it difficult to begin observing all the stringencies alone, it is a serious
violation of the commandment to place obstacles in the path of his drawing near
to the service of G‑d — one must not hinder, but rather help him.

When I was in distress and urgently needed help, when chronic phimosis caused
rupture of the foreskin, causing unbearable pain, and through the forming
fissures the wounds constantly bled, crying out to the Orthodoxes about the
necessity of urgent circumcision, it would have cost them nothing to help me,
to eliminate the threat to health and life.  But instead of help they only
indifferently gazed upon my suffering, pretending that my bleeding wounds did
not concern them.  Not only do the Torah and all of TaNaKh emphasize the need
to help those in need, but also the Talmud says that showing indifference to the
troubles and sufferings of one's neighbor is a non-Jewish trait, characteristic
of pagans.  It is precisely for this that this commandment was given, which the
Orthodoxes ignore.

| (Devarim [6:13](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.13)) |
{: .chapter}

After the Orthodoxes refused to circumcise me, I continued studying Torah on my
own and agonizingly sought an answer to the question of why they had treated me
this way, why they were not afraid to violate G‑d's commandment to circumcise me.

I had no unrealistic expectations, I did not expect Orthodoxes to be holy
righteous ones, tzaddikim.  But I still thought they feared G‑d.  However,
it turned out that Orthodoxes fear not G‑d, but only their rabbis.

While the Torah commanded doing good deeds, the Orthodoxes are bound by fear of
transgressing prescriptions invented by rabbis, and therefore fear to do good
deeds — out of fear of violating rabbinic stringencies.  Orthodox communities
are permeated with an atmosphere of fear before the rabbis, and because of this
the Orthodoxes are afraid to do deeds pleasing to G‑d.

I have had occasions when I put myself in the place of the Orthodoxes, and
this allowed me to understand the motivation behind their actions that hinders
doing good deeds.

For example, there was once such an incident in the yeshiva.  In the summer it
was hot inside the yeshiva building, so to cool the air they had to turn on the
air conditioner (*mazgan*).  The more experienced old-timers, even in summer heat,
would consistently set the correct air conditioner temperature to 23°C (73°F) —
this is the most optimal temperature for comfortable conditions, so that over
an extended period it would be neither hot nor cold.

And so once, just before the onset of Shabbat, young people came in from the
summer heat.  They felt so hot that they lowered the air conditioner temperature
to 16°C (60°F).  At first they enjoyed the cool air coming from the air conditioner.
But some time after the onset of Shabbat, everyone had already cooled down from
the heat, while the air conditioner continued to chill the air, and then all
felt upon themselves the consequences of such an ill-considered decision.
Some had warm winter jackets left hanging in the wardrobe, and they put them on.
But for most it was still very cold — they were in light summer clothing,
and it felt as cold as inside a freezer.

In the end they could not bear it any longer, approached me, and asked me
directly to turn off the air conditioner.  Such a request shocked me —
how could one ask directly, without even a hint, to violate the Sabbath!

I am familiar with the details of Halakhah, according to which the prohibition
of turning off an air conditioner is established by the sages, and is not
considered a Torah prohibition, and based on the fact that this is forbidden
only by rabbinic decree, there is a catch by which it is permissible to ask
a non-Jew to turn off the air conditioner, since this is a violation of a double
rabbinic prohibition to avoid discomfort: *shvut de‑shvut* = *amirah le‑nokhri*
plus electricity *derabbanan*.

But I was struck by the fact that instead of teaching the laws of the Sabbath,
the Orthodoxes train prospective converts to violate the Sabbath by asking them
to work on Shabbat as *shabbos goyim*, thereby transgressing the Torah's
prohibition against permitting strangers to work within a Jew's domain.
Therefore, when they asked me to violate the Sabbath, I became frightened that
perhaps they were testing me in this way, like during an exam, to see whether
I was truly capable of violating the Sabbath.

Then I said that I would go look for a cleaning woman to turn off the air
conditioner, left the room, but did not find a cleaning woman, and was afraid to
return.  I imagined a scenario in which as soon as I pressed the air conditioner
button, I would immediately be told that this was a test to determine my
readiness to observe the Sabbath laws, and that I had failed this test,
and after that I would be expelled from the yeshiva in disgrace.

<!-- On the other hand, taking into account the fact that according to the Torah
Jewish identity is transmitted through the paternal line, we can say that by my
refusal to violate the Sabbath I was saving the Orthodoxes from sin when they
asked a Jew to violate the Sabbath.  And from a third perspective, turning off
the air conditioner is not work at all. -->

Thus, despite how much I wanted to help them, I could not do a good deed — out
of fear of punishment from the rabbis.  That is how I understood the reason why
the Orthodoxes are incapable of doing good deeds — because of the prevailing
atmosphere of fear, because of the apprehension of violating some of the
countless stringencies imposed by the rabbis.

I have often noticed that when I needed help from them, they would fearfully,
with panic in their eyes, begin feverishly to calculate whether it could be
done, whether it violated some rabbinic prohibition.  And even not recalling
anything forbidding it, they would still try to retreat as quickly as possible.
That is, they would not be opposed to helping others, but they fear
transgressing some invented stringency.  By this logic, one can avoid
transgressing the enormous number of prohibitions only by doing nothing at all.

The Orthodoxes believe that one can be righteous simply by doing nothing,
in accordance with the aphorism “He who does nothing makes no mistakes”,
and therefore they avoid performing good deeds.  That is, their soul is not
engaged, only their mind.  The soul does not develop through helping those in
need, but only the mind mechanically calculates situations and matches them
against prescribed behavioral patterns.

All of this resembles some sort of [absurdist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism)
game with an enormous number of exceedingly convoluted rules, which through
discussions they attempt to work out in painstaking detail across a vast
quantity of thick volumes, yet still remain incompletely defined —
for each individual detail there exists a wide range of differing opinions.

The experience felt as though I had stepped into the books of Kafka.
<!-- The behavior of the Orthodoxes so resembles the behavior of characters in
Franz Kafka's works that I even began to suspect Kafka had the Orthodoxes in mind.  -->
The conversion process resembled the book *[The Trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial)*
with its incomprehensible and illogical actions of a bureaucratic machine,
grinding up destinies and transforming human persons into cogs in the system.
<!-- Like the Soviet system breaking people's lives. -->
For example, first they would expel me with humiliations, and then accuse me
of not wanting to come to them.  And the Orthodoxes inaccessibility recalled the
atmosphere of Kafka's book *[The Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_(novel))*.
<!-- Beginning with arriving at the yeshiva with a letter exactly as in *The Castle*,
and ending with the schizophrenic situation — I know with certainty that I am Jewish,
yet the Orthodoxes assert otherwise, demanding I renounce my Jewishness. -->

For example, I was constantly sent in incomprehensible directions: at first
Orthodoxes expelled me from Israel, and then other rabbis kept kicking me back
to Israel, i.e., the Orthodox rabbis simply lied to get rid of me, which is yet
another instance of placing a stumbling block before the blind.
Yevamot [65b](https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.65b.8) permits speaking
falsehood only for the sake of establishing peace, i.e., a “saving lie” is
permitted, as well as for self-defense.  This is the opposite of what is called
“placing a stumbling block before the blind” — when deception causes harm.
Thus one may lie only when there is no harm and no suffering is inflicted
upon anyone.

Due to the enormous number of fabricated restrictions and prescriptions,
their behavior is so strictly determined that little room remains for the
exercise of free will; the soul's capacity for independent problem-solving
is diminished, with few opportunities for trials through which the soul
develops — that is, there is no longer any work of the soul.  And because
the soul does not work, the soul gradually atrophies.

Then I began to investigate why it happened that the originally mighty stream of
Divine light, which through the Torah had formed modern civilization, dried up
among the Orthodoxes and turned into a thin trickle incapable of contributing to
the rectification of the world, and the Orthodoxes found themselves buried under
an enormous mountain of numerous rules and minor restrictive stringencies
that shackle free will and hinder good deeds.
And here is what I discovered through studying the Torah.

| And I shall give you the stone tablets, and the Torah, and the commandment, which I have written for their instruction | וְאֶתְּנָ֨ה לְךָ֜ אֶת־לֻחֹ֣ת הָאֶ֗בֶן וְהַתּוֹרָה֙ וְהַמִּצְוָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר כָּתַ֖בְתִּי לְהוֹרֹתָֽם |
|| (Shemot [24:12](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.24.12)) |
{: .chapter #oral title="Oral Torah"}

To imagine the events that took place after the Exodus,
we can travel back 3333 years in our minds.

And here we see how Moshe ascends Mount Sinai,
and hews from stone two tablets *luhot ha‑brit*,
and carves upon them the words which G‑d placed in Moshe's mind:
<!-- through revelation, illumination, inspiration, intuition -->
10 eternal commandments for all time — *aseret ha‑dvarim*.
<!-- Also known as *aseret ha‑dibrot* from *divrei ha‑brit*. -->

Moshe also receives from G‑d the foundation of the teaching and commandments.
And then over the course of 40 years Moshe records all the knowledge received
from G‑d in the Written Torah.  Therefore we can say that all the commandments
and the Torah G‑d wrote by the hand of Moshe.

In *Moreh Nevukhim* [1:65-66](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_Part_1.65.4)
Rambam, in the vein of rationalism, raises the question of comparing the
creation of the heavens and the tablets.  Evidently, the words of Tehillim
[33:6](https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.33.6) “By the word of the L‑rd were the
heavens made” can be understood to mean that the Universe was created by G‑d's
program, i.e., referring to the program of evolution by which the world
developed.  In contrast to this, when it is said that the tablets were written
“by the finger of G‑d” and called “the work of G‑d”, it refers to G‑d's direct
intervention in the operation of the program by communicating to Moshe the laws
of humanity's moral evolution.

The process of writing down the Written Torah was not completed at once.
The narrative portion began with the recording of past events: the history
following the creation of the world, the deeds of the Patriarchs, and up to the
exodus from Egypt had been transmitted orally for many centuries before being
fixed in the Written Torah.  Subsequently, the narrative portion during the
wandering in the wilderness was updated with descriptions of events that
occurred as they progressed, when G‑d guided the people of Israel.
There are many examples where G‑d directly commands Moshe what needs
to be written down in the Torah.
<!-- For example, in Shemot [17:14](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.17.14)
regarding Devarim [25:19](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.25.19). -->

And even after Moshe's death the Torah continued to be renewed through the
prophecies of his successors, when the final events of Moshe's life were
recorded.  What is said in the book of Yehoshua
[24:26](https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.24.26) about Yehoshua bin-Nun
inscribing “these words” in the book of the Torah is explained in Makkot
[11a](https://www.sefaria.org/Makkot.11a.5) and Bava Batra
[15a](https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.15a.4) to mean that Yehoshua
added the final eight verses of the Torah concerning Moshe's death.
<!-- And noted in Bemidbar [12:3](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.12.3)
that Moshe was the most humble of people.  -->

An illustration of such a possibility has emerged nowadays, when G‑d gives
answers to many unresolved questions: for example, a person maintains a blog
on the Internet, and then suddenly dies — in this case the final entry with
notification of the blog owner's death is left by his/her relatives or friends
who have access to the deceased's blog.

This resolves the paradox of
[self-reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reference), where in Devarim
[31:9](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.31.9) the words of the Torah
referring to themselves — “And Moshe wrote down this Torah” — could be
interpreted as a [quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)).
If at Sinai a description had been given of all events that would subsequently
occur, this would have excluded free choice, which would contradict the words of
the Torah regarding the necessity of exercising free choice in order to perform
good deeds.

<!-- See also Ibn Ezra's commentaries on
Beresheet [36:31](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.36.31?with=Ibn%20Ezra) and
Devarim [1:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.1.2?with=Ibn%20Ezra),
and his commentary on Bemidbar [21:1-3](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.21.1?with=Ibn%20Ezra),
and Ramban on Bemidbar [21:1-3](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.21.1?with=Ramban)
as well as [Spinoza's](https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/81190) opinion. -->

The legislative part of the Torah was also gradually supplemented with new laws.
In the wilderness, new situations frequently arose that were not regulated by
existing laws.  Therefore they required the adoption of new ordinances.  Then
Moshe would turn to G‑d, present the case under consideration, and G‑d would
place in Moshe's mind the solution to the problem, which Moshe would then
articulate and record.

For example, at Sinai the commandment to observe Shabbat was given,
but it was not known which specific actions were forbidden on that day.
And so, when the children of Israel were in the wilderness, an opportunity was
provided, described in Bemidbar [15:32-36](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.15.32-36),
which served as a precedent for clarifying the requirement of the law: one
person was gathering wood on the Sabbath.  He was caught, and it was unclear
whether he had performed work forbidden on the Sabbath, and if so, how grave
his transgression was, how he should be dealt with, what punishment he deserved.
Then G‑d informed Moshe, that is, placed thoughts in his mind by means
of prophecy, what punishment was applicable in this case.
And based on the severity of this punishment, knowledge was obtained
that this action constitutes a serious violation of the Sabbath.

During the composition of the Torah there were other such precedential
cases of adding new laws after consultation with G‑d, including
Vayikra [24:10-16](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.24.10-16)
concerning the blasphemer,
Bemidbar [9:6-14](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.9.6-14)
concerning Pesach Sheni,
Bemidbar [15:32-36](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.15.32-36)
concerning one who gathered wood on the Sabbath day,
Bemidbar [27:1-11](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.27.1-11)
concerning the daughters of Tzelofchad.

The laws continued to develop even after the death of Moshe.
For example, of the six planned cities of refuge in Bemidbar
[35:13](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.35.13), Moshe designates three in
Devarim [4:41](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.4.41), while the rest
were later designated and activated by Yehoshua bin-Nun
(Yehoshua [20](https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.20)).

Undoubtedly, besides the Written Torah, an oral interpretation of the laws was
also given, with detailed explanations of all particulars of their observance
and moral-ethical foundations. <!-- Despite the claim of
Mishnah Kiddushin [4](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kiddushin.4.14) that
the Patriarchs already fully observed the entire Torah before its reception. -->
This was like a [User Manual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_guide) —
without such instructions, it would be impossible to observe the
commandments, whose brief exposition was recorded in the Written Torah.
For example, in Shemot [27:8](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.27.8)
it was said: “Make it as you were shown on the mountain”, i.e.,
not only oral instructions, but also visual illustrations.

Later the term “Oral Torah” — *Torah she‑be'al peh* — was introduced to
designate the oral laws, in contrast to the Written Torah — *Torah she‑bikhtav*.
In the Talmud, in tractate Berakhot [5a](https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.5a.3),
the passage from Shemot [24:12](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.24.12) was
divided into the following components: the stone tablets — the 10 commandments,
Torah — the Chumash, commandment — the Mishnah, “which I have written” — the
Prophets and Writings, “to instruct them” — the Talmud.  But according to
the *peshat* there is nothing of the sort.  Rather, it clearly states that the
commandments were written on the stone tablets along with the Written Torah.
And of the “Oral Torah” there is not a word.  Therefore it would be more
accurate to use the terms ‘oral laws’, ‘oral traditions’.

For many centuries, all details of the laws had to be transmitted from
generation to generation orally — from teacher to student, from father to son.
It would seem everything is perfect: we should possess all the details of
the laws that were known at the time the laws were received at Sinai.

But, unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal world.  The Jewish people have
passed through many terrible events, misfortunes, and persecutions, during
which the chains of oral tradition transmission were broken and the lines of
*semikhah* (ordination) were severed — there was the dispersion of the ten
tribes, and the Babylonian exile of the remaining tribes from the Kingdom of
Judah after the destruction of the First Temple, and the Hellenistic prohibition
of all Jewish rites, and the wars with Rome, which ended in the destruction of
the Second Temple and the fall of Masada.

Because of the disruption of oral tradition transmission, many details of the laws
were forgotten.  Temurah [16a](https://www.sefaria.org/Temurah.16a.3-6) reports
that even during Moshe's lifetime Yehoshua forgot 300 halakhot, and 700 doubts
regarding the laws arose for him, and after Moshe's death, due to grief,
Yehoshua forgot another 3000 halakhot.

And later even more important laws were forgotten.
For example, in the entire TaNaKh there was not a single case where
a complete prohibition of military action made it impossible to defend on the Sabbath,
and this would have led to the defeat of the defending Jews.  The only case
was described in the book of Yehoshua [10](https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.10),
when on Friday the sun stood still in order to postpone the onset
of the Sabbath — then it remained possible to continue the battle without
violating the Sabbath (truly a miracle: all around it was Sabbath,
but for the Jews it was still Friday).  <!-- In *Moreh Nevukhim*
[2:35](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_Part_2.35.5)
Rambam explained that the sun stood still on the day of the summer solstice. -->
However, this battle was not for defense, but for an attack on the heathens.

And only at the end of the first millennium B.C.E. did the Jews forget this
detail of the oral tradition, and a problem arose, a detailed description of
which was left by Josephus Flavius.  In the book *Antiquities of the Jews*
[XII](https://www.sefaria.org/The_Antiquities_of_the_Jews.12), he recounts
a case when enemies entered Jerusalem on the Sabbath under the pretext of
offering a sacrifice, but instead captured the city, and the Jews exhibited not
the slightest resistance, because they had forgotten the oral law concerning
the permissibility of self-defense on the Sabbath.
<!-- Also, *The First Book of Maccabees*
[2:29-38](https://www.sefaria.org/The_Book_of_Maccabees_I.2.29-38) recounts
that after the Jews fled into the wilderness, enemies pursued them and
slaughtered a thousand, because they attacked the Jews on Sabbaths,
when they could not defend themselves. -->
After the defeat they fled to the priest Mattityahu, and it was decided
to permit defending oneself with weapons in hand for the purpose of
self-defense even on the Sabbath day.
<!-- Also *The First Book of Maccabees*
[2:40-41](https://www.sefaria.org/The_Book_of_Maccabees_I.2.40-41). -->
Later this rule was assigned to the category of *pikuach nefesh*, citing the
words of Vayikra [18:5](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.18.5): “You shall keep
My statutes and My laws, which if a person does, he shall live by them”.

<!-- This rule the Jews continued to follow thereafter.  The book
*The Jewish War* II describes how an enemy attack was repelled on the Sabbath.
But in the books *Jewish Antiquities* XIV and *The Jewish War* I
it is also recounted how later the Romans under Pompey took advantage of the
Sabbath prohibitions.  By that time the besieged Jews continued to repel enemy
attacks on the Sabbath.  Therefore the Romans ceased attacking, and instead on
the Sabbath prepared for subsequent offensives: they raised earthworks,
erected siege towers at the city walls, brought siege engines up to the camps,
etc.  And the Jews did not hinder them in this and did not fire upon them
on the Sabbath. -->

<!-- And in the book *The Jewish War* II
[17:10](https://www.sefaria.org/The_War_of_the_Jews.2.17.10) the opposite case
was presented — an offensive, when Jews attacked Romans on the Sabbath.
But the Roman tyrant procurators headed by the immoral Nero were to blame for
unleashing the war.  Later the day of Jerusalem's liberation, the 17th of Elul,
became a semi-festive day.  -->

The law prescribing dwelling in booths on the festival of Sukkot was not
observed from the time of Yehoshua bin-Nun until the day when it was suddenly
discovered in the Torah that the priest Ezra brought forth to the people
(Nehemiah [8:14-17](https://www.sefaria.org/Nehemiah.8.14-17)).

Even the Talmud repeatedly confirms the fact that the chain of transmission
of Torah laws was broken several times.  For example, in Sukkah
[20a](https://www.sefaria.org/Sukkah.20a.11) it is stated that when the Torah
was forgotten after the first exile, Ezra came from Babylon and restored it,
and when later the Torah was forgotten a second time, Hillel the Babylonian
came and restored it again, and when the Torah was forgotten yet again,
Rabbi Chiyya came with his sons and restored it once more.

In Pesachim [66a](https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.66a.3) and JT Pesachim
[6](https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.6.1.1) it was told that
the elders <!-- *zikney/bnei Batira* --> forgot whether one may perform the
Passover sacrifice on the Sabbath of the 14th of Nisan. <!-- on *Shabbat
HaGadol* -->  And then Hillel ruled that one may.  But then Hillel himself
forgot whether one may bring a knife for the Passover sacrifice on the Sabbath.
And so he delegated the resolution of this question to the entire people: though
prophets are no more, they are children of prophets (*bnei nevi'im*, sons of
prophets, i.e. descendants of prophets), <!-- in *Moreh Nevukhim*
[1:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_Part_1.7.2) children of
prophets are called disciples of prophets --> therefore they themselves will
devise what to do — a very wise idea in the spirit of Yirmeyahu
[31:33](https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.31.33).  <!-- And they then decided
to bring the knife in an unusual manner on the animal. -->

Another example: in Sanhedrin [88b](https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.88b.7)
it is stated <!-- Rabbi Yose lamented --> that because the disciples of Shammai
and Hillel did not listen attentively to their teachers, disputes multiplied,
as if the Jews had not one Torah but two.

The tragic events of Jewish history so narrowed the link between generations
that the stream of transmitted traditions dwindled to a narrow bottleneck,
to the eye of a needle, when at one point only a handful of tradition-bearers
remained.  And they could well have agreed among themselves to alter the oral
laws according to their own ideas.  For example, after the death from plague of
24,000 students of Rabbi Akiva, only 5 students remained who transmitted the
oral tradition from him.  Based on the opinions of one of them, the Mishnah
was later recorded; based on the opinions of another, the Tosefta; and based
on the opinions of the rest, the midrashim
(Sanhedrin [86a](https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.86a.3)).
That is, the entire recorded “Oral Torah” is based solely on the words of Rabbi
Akiva, <!-- descendant of idolaters --> transmitted by him to his student Rabbi
Meir. <!-- descendant of Nero -->  This was a weak link in the chain of
transmission of the oral laws.

But such unspoken agreements were infrequent.  For the most part, changes
to the oral laws occurred publicly.  The sole requirement legitimizing the
changes introduced — that the author of the changes be an authority recognized
by the majority.  Many examples are widely known when changes were introduced
with majority support by the head of the Sanhedrin.  Later in Babylonia,
decisions were made by the Gaon.  The greater the authority a sage possessed,
the more fundamental the changes to the laws he could institute.

During the Second Temple period, each of the three Jewish movements existing
at that time had its own “Oral Torah”, i.e. its own laws.  The
[Sadducees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadducees) (*Zadokites*)
intended to adhere only to the literal interpretation of the Written Torah,
rejected any deviations from what was written, and denied the legitimacy
of oral laws.
Nevertheless, the Sadducees were forced to devise their own version of
an “Oral Torah”, because due to the large number of lacunae in the written text,
the necessity remained to restore their meaning, and for this they had to
choose from multiple variants of interpreting unclear passages.

It is now difficult to trace the history of these movements' origins, but
apparently for a long time the main movement was the Sadducees, who received
their name from Zadok.  In fact, they only received this name after the
founders of another movement — the Perushim — separated from them.
<!-- The word “Pharisees” is not used here to avoid connotations with antisemitic slanders. -->
The word *Perushim* means “the separated ones”.  Regarding names, such word
formation is a natural process: when a division of the whole occurs, each part
receives a [new name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_schisms).  Thus the
name *Rabbanites* was introduced to distinguish from *Karaites*.  Similarly, the
Litvaks received their name *Mitnagdim* when the *Hasidim* separated from them.
Later, by the same principle, during the Haskalah, the *Orthodoxes* received
their current name in opposition to the *Maskilim*.  Recently the name *Haredim*
appeared after the formation of the *Religious Zionist* movement, as well as
*Hardal* and *Modernists*, etc.

Unlike the Sadducees, the Perushim regarded the development of oral traditions
as a natural process and actively participated in it.  Thanks to this
progressive approach, the Perushim altered the interpretation of laws, applying
them to new conditions of life, and thereby gained popularity among the people.
The Sadducees, however, clung to long-outdated traditions.  But literal
adherence to old laws was incompatible with the level of societal development
at that time.  Therefore, the Sadducees were doomed to disappear.

In the same way, in our time the Orthodox movement has come into conflict with
the contemporary level of societal development, as many traditions of medieval
Halakhah have become hopelessly outdated.  Therefore, the heirs of the Perushim
now find themselves in the position of their former opponents the Sadducees,
cut off from the people.  Just as the Sadducees adhered only to the letter of the
law but not its spirit, and degenerated into mechanical observance of rituals at
the expense of spiritual development, so now with the Orthodoxes.  And just as
with the Sadducees, because of their inability to adapt to new conditions, the
Orthodoxes have grown rigid, halted in their development, and are rapidly losing
popularity among the entire Jewish people, forgetting that in the era of the
Second Temple the Perushim achieved prosperity and overcame problems only
because they adapted the oral laws to the expectations of the people in
accordance with the new level of morality.  One of many examples: the Perushim
made difficult and even practically impossible the application of harsh
punishments, and also abolished the literal understanding of the law
“an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth”, and many similar reforms
in the spirit of filling with Divine light.

With the support of the common people, the rabbis participated in legislation.
As a result of sharp debates between different schools within the Perushim
movement, many new laws were born.  An exemplary instance of constructive
debates is the reconciliation of positions between the school of Shammai
and the school of Hillel — *Beit Shammai* vs *Beit Hillel*.
<!-- Often the school of Hillel is credited with always granting their opponents
the right to speak first.  But in reality this is simply a trick, a stratagem,
such a polemical device. -->
The disputes between them pursued one noble goal — the establishment of truth,
i.e., they debated for the sake of Heaven, *le‑shem Shammaim*.  Thanks to this
they had hope that the interpretations of laws they found follow the will of G‑d,
and that the oral laws they adopted correspond to the commandments of the
Written Torah.
<!-- I too in this book have striven for the establishment of truth. -->

But the fatal error of the later rabbis was that the dynamic development of
the oral laws was interrupted a few years after the destruction of the Second
Temple, when all the oral laws that existed at that time were cemented in
written form.  This violated the centuries-old tradition of interpreting the
Torah in accordance with the needs of the present day and transformed the oral
Torah that existed at that moment into a second Written Torah.

Moreover, the Perushim themselves had earlier categorically rejected the idea of
writing down oral laws, as the Sadducees did.  The Sadducees recorded their oral
laws in the “Book of Punishments”, specifying which violations warranted
stoning, which burning, which beheading, which hanging, etc.  On one of the days
of Tammuz, the Perushim destroyed the Sadducean “Book of Punishments”, and the
day of the abolition of these written oral laws was declared a festive date.
Later this rule was mentioned in Megillat Ta'anit
[Tammuz](https://www.sefaria.org/Megillat_Ta'anit,_Tammuz) as “halakhot are not
to be written in a book” — so that each generation would have the ability to
interpret laws in accordance with constantly changing moral norms.  Therefore
they were able to abolish capital punishment for transgressions when these laws
were no longer written down anywhere.

Paradoxically, in the written-down “Oral Torah”, the very act of recording oral
laws is self-critically condemned — in the Talmudic tractate Temurah
[14b](https://www.sefaria.org/Temurah.14b.2) it is recorded that Rabbi Abba said
that Rabbi Yochanan transmitted such an oral rule: that one who writes down oral
laws is like one who burns the Torah.

It can be stated with certainty that had the rabbis not made the error of
writing down the oral laws, and had the oral ordinance concerning the temporary
switch from paternal to maternal lineage after the occupation of Judea by Roman
invaders remained an oral law and not been recorded as a written law, then
shortly after the cessation of the need for this temporary ordinance, the
paternal line would have been easily restored, and now people might not even
know that it had once been otherwise.

If we draw historical parallels, we can observe that the Written Torah
was given as a Constitution — an immutable fundamental law.
<!-- Moreover, the code of laws was assembled upon the advice of
Moshe's father-in-law. -->  However, it does not conflict with the
[Constitution of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Laws_of_Israel),
because such a document has not yet been adopted.  The Torah as Constitution
defines rights and obligations, where rights correspond to the category of
*chesed*, and obligations to *gevurah*.  These same categories also parallel
blessings (rewards) and curses (punishments).

Further, we can say that the oral tradition is based on precedents, on
[case law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_law),
where the primary source of law is previous judicial decisions rather than the
Constitution.  Once a rabbi issues a ruling on a particular case, in subsequent
generations it becomes virtually impossible to overturn it.  Over time it
acquires the status of law — and later it becomes more difficult to reverse
a previously rendered decision, even when it conflicts with society's level of
development.

Yet another analogy — the constant changes to the written law
in the form of oral laws correspond to
[amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_amendment)
to the Constitution, which have the capacity to modify the unchanging
fundamental law in accordance with new requirements of the times.
For example, the aforementioned example of permitting the violation of the
Sabbath for self-defense can be called an amendment to the Constitution, etc.
Indeed, all of current Halakha is not the Constitution, since it was not adopted
by a majority of the people, but simply a collection of amendments.

But such an order corresponds to a form of government
that is not a constitutional monarchy, but rather
[theocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theocracy),
where absolute power belongs to the rabbis.

And in the times of the kings it took the form of a theocratic monarchy.
Nevertheless, in that social order, as described in the book of Devarim
and realized in Shoftim, there was
a [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers).
Executive power belonged to the king as the secular ruler.
Legislative power — to the sages.  Judicial power — to the priesthood.
And the [fourth estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Estate) —
these were the prophets, who exposed the vices of the first three
branches of power.  This task corresponds to what is said in Eikhah
[2:14](https://www.sefaria.org/Lamentations.2.14): “they did not expose
your iniquity”.  In the modern world, this power belongs to independent media,
journalists, activists, and public figures who engage in constructive criticism
of the other branches of power, warn those in authority about the possible
consequences of their destructive actions, thereby preventing a slide into
extreme authoritarian and totalitarian forms, which inevitably lead, in the end,
to the degradation of society and the dissolution of the state.

In Jewish history there existed yet another form of government —
on the pages of the Talmud we can observe an example of genuine democracy,
where all features accompanying liberal democracy manifested themselves:
both freedom of speech and pluralism of opinions.  Thus the further
development of oral legislation continued in written form as discussions,
where each participant had his own opinion and freely expressed it.
In contrast to various types of autocracies, when laws
are formally followed only under the threat of punishment,
that ultimately leads to decline, in a democracy free citizens
voluntarily assume responsibility for the development of society.
Democracy fits ideally into Judaism when we perceive the Torah
not as law but as teaching, which in fact the Torah is
as a coherent system of moral principles.

But in the Medieval period there occurred a descent into totalitarianism and
tyranny was established, which authoritatively fixed in law all private
opinions, sometimes even erroneous ones, thereby limiting all further
discussions.  Not for nothing did there exist a prohibition on recording the
oral laws — this allowed oral traditions to develop over many centuries.
But after codification, the fixation of all medieval traditions existing
at that moment was performed, and after this the development of Judaism
completely stopped — it became impossible to implement necessary adjustments
to meet the new demands of life.  This inflicted harm upon Judaism even
worse than antisemites could have managed to inflict.

The result was one of the worst examples of dystopia, founded on fear, where
a person lives under round-the-clock surveillance, every action regulated down
to the smallest detail by draconian laws, and the slightest deviation from the
Party's general line is mercilessly punished.  It is therefore unsurprising that
at the first opportunity, at the first weakening of total control, the majority
broke free from slavery into freedom.  This serves as an indicator that due
to fundamental errors <!-- time bomb --> the development went down the wrong path.

Whence, then, came such an enormous quantity of directives and instructions in
the oral laws, shackling free will and dragging the Orthodoxes down like
attached weights of stringencies, when it is known that nothing of the sort
existed among the Jewish people in ancient times?

To answer this question, an apt analogy may be helpful.  There is a game called
*[Telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_game)*.  In this game,
participants pass an oral message to one another in a chain.  As the number of
links increases, distortion of the original message inevitably occurs — in the
process of retelling from one participant to another, errors accumulate such
that the message of the last participant differs substantially from the message
of the first, because each link in the chain introduces its own changes.

<!-- [Video-illustration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByG8ZldkLAg). -->

A similar figurative comparison to the game of telephone was offered by
Rabbenu Bahya in [Chovot HaLevavot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chovot_HaLevavot),
*Gate of the Divine Unity*,
[2:6](https://www.sefaria.org/Duties_of_the_Heart,_First_Treatise_on_Unity.2.6),
where a chain of blind people, each placing a hand on the shoulder of the one
before, wander until they deviate from the path established by the single
sighted person at the head of the column, <!-- Moshe Rabbeinu and prophets -->
and then the blind fall into a pit.

<!-- To understand how information absent from the original formulation gets
added, let us consider an example.  Imagine that in the beginning, the word
“table” was given.  And one rabbi orally transmitted this word to another.
But the next rabbi was not satisfied with his role as a mere cog in the wheel;
he displayed creativity and decided to embellish the received word, transmitting
to his students the phrase “set table”.  The next rabbi added yet another word
and transmitted “set table with a tablecloth”.  And the rabbis of the next
generation began to specify what utensils should stand on the table and in
precisely what order.  And subsequent generations added even more stringencies —
what dishes should be on the table, etc.  And as a result, we have what we have.
From one word emerged an entire library with numerous volumes.  This is an
example of additions only, but in reality there were also many deletions and
distortions. -->

All this testifies to the unreliability of oral transmission of information.
Whereas the Written Torah was transmitted from generation to generation with the
reliability of [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) — each
available copy was carefully cross-checked against the majority of others, and
thus copying errors were immediately detected.  In contrast, oral transmission
is subject to the influence of noise.  Therefore, when transmitting voice
information over telephone lines, etc., various technical solutions for
[error detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction)
were devised, including the use of such error-resistant encoding as
[error-correcting codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code),
for detecting and correcting errors.  Without such precautions in oral
transmission, the errors of the sages accumulated like
[rounding errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-off_error) —
just as in banks a substantial sum can accrue when errors accumulate,
if no measures are taken against it.  Therefore, it becomes impossible
to know that an error has occurred, and consequently, impossible to correct
errors made by previous generations.

But no such protective systems existed, and nothing prevented the transmitted
information from being altered, because two main factors exerted their influence.
First, external *force majeure* circumstances — due to calamities that befell
the people, details of many laws of the Written Torah were lost, and later a new
interpretation was invented from scratch for some of them.  Second, the rabbis
themselves constantly engaged in “improvements” of the oral laws.  After the
recording of the Mishnah and Talmud, this fact has indisputable written
evidence, as fierce debates were conducted over even the slightest question.
These unceasing disputes and the absence of clear understanding of many
commandments show that the oral tradition was lost and forgotten, and later
invented anew.  Even current Halakha contradicts the Mishnah on certain
questions, for each question of Halakha there exist many opinions, and halakhic
disputes have not subsided to this day, so that Orthodoxes can only hope that
Mashiach will come and set things in order.

For example, no one knows precisely which birds were meant when listing the
non-kosher ones, or which disease was called *tzara'at*.  Today no one remembers
the secret of making *tekhelet* — instructions for making *tallitot* with fringes
dyed in tekhelet were not passed down to subsequent generations.  Details of
many other traditions were also lost, because ancestors did not foresee that
ordinary concepts known to all of them could be forgotten.

The traditions of interpreting the words about the sign on the hand and the
reminder between the eyes were forgotten, and so *tefillin* were invented,
which underwent numerous modifications.  Some Orthodoxes attempt to trace the
existence of tefillin all the way back to Sinai, claiming that after Moshe
received general instructions about tefillin, there was an opportunity to choose
a practical implementation from several options, but Yehoshua became confused
and left several opinions.  Haven't the Orthodoxes attributed too many sins to him?

<!-- Archaeological excavations show that tefillin began to appear in the Qumran
communities.  The Essenes wore tefillin all day long like mobile phones, so
their boxes were small in size, i.e., they differed significantly from modern
ones in both size and shape — there were round ones and oblong ones.
Some wore even gilded ones for show, but were condemned for it.  There were
also differences in the contents of the boxes: for example, some contained
the text of the Ten Commandments. -->

The medieval authority Rashi ruled that the passages should be arranged in one
order, but his grandson Rabbenu Tam did not heed his grandfather and devised
a different order for arranging the passages in the tefillin.  Therefore today
some Orthodoxes <!-- Chabad Hasidim --> are compelled to acquire an additional
set of tefillin according to the opinion of Rabbenu Tam, and to repeat the prayer
once more, removing one tefillin and donning the other in its place.

A similar story occurred with *mezuzot*: Rashi commanded that mezuzot be hung
vertically, but his grandson again disobeyed his grandfather and, contrary to
his grandfather, turned the mezuzot horizontally.  Therefore as a compromise
(based on the opinion of Ramo in Shulchan Arukh Yoreh De'ah
[289:6](https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.289.6))
the intermediate orientation of the mezuzah is now accepted:
neither vertical nor horizontal, but on an angle in a slanted position —
<!-- as [italic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_type) -->
just as after the rabbis' dispute in
Bava Metzia [59b](https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.59b.3)
the wall remained in a slanted position. <!-- tilted, inclined, leaning -->

<!-- Why not combine the two opinions in exactly the same way and make one
tefillin with two sets of passages, or simply duplicate one passage:
before and after another.  Perhaps because Rashi, in his commentary on Devarim
[4:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.4.2?with=Rashi) and
[13:1](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.13.1?with=Rashi),
cited as a counter-example five passages instead of the prescribed four
in accordance with tradition. -->

In the same Bava Metzia [59b](https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.59b.5), the
rabbis justified their choice by attributing words to G‑d, as if G‑d replied
with resignation: “Have it your way”, as in the famous joke:

> Moses is standing at Sinai and G‑d says to him,
“You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.”  
Moses asks,
“So are You saying that we shouldn't eat milk and meat together?”  
G‑d replies a little impatiently,
“I said: You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.”  
Moses, still puzzled, says, “Do you want us to wait six hours
after a meat meal before eating dairy foods?  Is that what you mean?”  
G‑d, a bit more impatiently this time, reiterates,
“I said: You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.”  
Moses asks again,
“Wait.  You want us to use separate tablecloths for meat meals and dairy meals?”  
G‑d replies with resignation,
“You know what?  Have it your way.”  
   
(translation quoted from the book by Eliezer Diamond, “But Is It Funny?
Identifying Humor, Satire, and Parody in Rabbinic Literature”)

This joke is correct in essence, but contains a fundamental error — it
groundlessly accuses Moshe, while the blame lies with later rabbis who added
many additional stringencies to Moshe's law.  This joke vindicates the
Orthodoxes who claim that modern stringencies were given to Moshe at Sinai.
But this is unfair to Moshe.  Therefore I feel very hurt on his behalf when
he is portrayed in an unfavorable light as the culprit of these stringencies.

When the joke places blame on Moshe, this is a tremendous injustice, caused by
the Orthodox legend that all medieval stringencies were invented by Moshe.
If Moshe had determined that there exists a requirement for separate dishes,
that after meat one must wait six hours, etc., then he would have written it
that way in the Written Torah as *peshat*, so that it would be clear and
understandable to everyone what specifically needed to be done.  It is possible
that Moshe wrote this phrase about the kid as a prohibition against imitating
pagans, to distance the people from customs prevalent in pagan cults,
as Rambam suggested in *Moreh Nevukhim*
[3:48](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_Part_3.48.8).

Therefore, this joke should more accurately look something like this:
Moshe was transported from his own time several centuries into the future and
found himself in Rabbi Akiva's beit midrash at a lesson on studying Halakhah.
Moshe sat in the back row and began listening to the teacher's explanations.
Exams are approaching, and it was necessary to learn all the new laws
in time, but the reasoning about deriving new laws “from the crowns above the
letters” is incomprehensible.  Then he felt weak, and his strength left him.
So he raises his hand and asks where such an enormous multitude of new laws
came from.  And they answer him that this is Halakhah received by Moshe at Sinai.
And then Moshe replies with resignation: “You know what?  Have it your way.”

<!-- And if Rabbi Akiva were transported to a modern beit midrash,
he would be even more astounded by the innovations of the Orthodoxes. -->

Only this is not a joke but rather an aggadah — from the Talmudic tractate
Menachot [29b](https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.29b.3), where it states
that Moshe reconciled himself to these additions.  But if we attempt to
impartially imagine Moshe's feelings, his confusion is understandable when
from his words “You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk” many laws are
derived in the beit midrash concerning the separation of meat and dairy.
Therefore we can continue this joke further so that as in the telephone game
one rabbi devised a new stringency: “do not eat meat with dairy”, then
another added: “do not derive benefit from such a mixture”, later a third
added still more: “fowl is also meat”, and further those following him introduce
separate utensils for dairy and meat, moreover with different laws
for Sephardim and Ashkenazim, etc.
<!-- Approximately as
in Hilkhot Mamrim [2:9](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Rebels.2.9),
only in a different order. -->
And in the end, from a brief phrase are derived 190 pages of
the textbook “Meat and Dairy: An Illustrated Halachic Guide”,
complete with numerous formulas, illustrations, tables and charts.
<!-- Yet contradictions remain: for example, between a meat meal
and a dairy one they require up to 6 hours, but after a dairy meal one may eat
meat immediately, despite the fact that one could assume that digestion
in the stomach is similar to cooking. -->

Incidentally, in that very same aforementioned place in the Talmud,
a new term is introduced unambiguously: “the Torah of Rabbi Akiva”.
As has already been clearly shown, this dogma cannot withstand any criticism
that modern Halakhah, including the contents of the Shulchan Arukh, and aggadic
stories were given at Sinai
<!-- [Halakhah le‑Moshe mi‑Sinai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_given_to_Moses_at_Sinai) -->
and have reached us in the unchanged form in which they now exist, with all
recent additions.  Belief in this postulate is akin to blind faith that the
world was created complete with buried dinosaur bones.  But here something else
is being asserted — that in reality, modern Halakhah is the Torah of Rabbi Akiva.
And this means nothing other than recognizing the fact that he
<!-- a descendant of the Canaanites who hated the Torah of Moshe until age 40, -->
<!-- (i.e., until age 40 he was destroying the Torah from without,
and then continued to destroy the Torah from within) -->
<!-- and also believed in the false Messiah (Bar Kokhba), -->
<!-- and subsequently became a role model for the Orthodoxes, -->
replaced the Torah of Moshe with his new Torah.
<!-- (i.e., practically a “new testament”) -->
<!-- In this sense the situation resembles that of Herod, a descendant of
Idumeans, who became king in violation of the prohibition against appointing
non-Jewish rulers by descent, yet among whose few merits one may count
the reconstruction of the Second Temple. -->
He derived new laws from the arrangement of words and letters in the text,
disregarding its meaning, i.e., practically employing methods similar to
[gematria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria).  And these new laws,
derived through allegorical interpretation, received the status of Torah laws.
And it was commanded to believe that all these new laws were given at Sinai
in oral form — a fundamentally unverifiable claim.

The school of Rabbi Akiva was opposed by the school of Rabbi Ishmael, who
adhered to *peshat* — the plain understanding of the text's meaning, guided by
the principle *dibra Torah ki‑leshon bnei adam* — “The Torah speaks in human
language” (Keritot [11a](https://www.sefaria.org/Keritot.11a.11)…).  That is,
the differences between them were mainly that one based interpretation of the
text on form, while the other on content.  One followed the letter, the other
the spirit of the Torah.  <!-- So too now, Orthodoxy is form that has lost its
content. -->  This opposition is well illustrated, for example, in the dispute
between them in Sanhedrin [51b](https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.51b.17),
where Rabbi Akiva wished to issue a death sentence based on a single superfluous
letter alone, while Rabbi Ishmael dissuaded him.  But subsequently, unfortunately,
the followers of Rabbi Akiva prevailed, having departed from the plain meaning
into the realm of bizarre phantasmagoria.

This deviation manifests notably in debates between these schools.
For example, in Chagigah [6b](https://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.6a.17)
and Zevachim [115b](https://www.sefaria.org/Zevachim.115b.16)
in disputes concerning the sequence of receiving the Torah, Rabbi Ishmael
offered the only reasonable explanation: that at Sinai the general commandments
were received, including the 10 on the tablets, while the details were revealed later.
But Rabbi Akiva objected that everything was received at Sinai — thereby
contradicting the Torah and common sense.  Subsequently, the departure
from the Torah and common sense only continued to worsen.

Therefore, based on this, we can make the following generalization: The Torah
of Moshe is the Written Torah of the Land of Israel.  The Torah of Rabbi Akiva
is the oral Torah of exile, which began after the destruction of the Temple
under Roman conquerors and continued in the medieval diaspora.  But after the
restoration of Israel, the Torah of galut must yield to the restored Torah of
Moshe, adapted to the contemporary conditions of life both for the entire
country and for each individual.

<!-- In Sefer HaBahir [149](https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaBahir.149)
an excellent comparison is brought.  Based on what is said in Mishlei
[6:23](https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.6.23), that Torah is light and the
commandment is a lamp, the conclusion is drawn that the light is the Written
Torah, and the lamp is the Oral.  And further, this example is given:
in a distant corner of a house there is a hidden room, in which it is dark even
during the day, when throughout the world there is light everywhere.  Thus, to
illuminate the room, one lights a lamp.  This is the Oral Torah.  The hidden
room is none other than the Galut.  Therefore in the Galut the Oral Torah is needed.
And the light that illuminates the world and Israel is the Written Torah. -->

Based on written sources, we can observe how after the destruction of the
Temple a gradual detachment from reality occurred, which reached its apogee in
Rashi's aggadic commentaries.  Already the very first commentary discusses
a purely utilitarian attitude toward the Torah where from the Torah are expected
not instructive stories for moral development, but only a detailed program of
household activities to be performed daily, like a list of rules in the
Shulchan Arukh with detailed instructions.
{: #midrash title="midrashim"}

When I began to familiarize myself with Rashi's commentaries on the Torah,
I approached the matter impartially and with full seriousness.  Until then
I had heard only positive reviews that extolled Rashi's commentaries as the
pinnacle of wisdom.  Everyone advised that if one had the opportunity to study
the commentaries of a single author, one should prefer Rashi, whose commentaries
should suffice for a complete understanding of the Torah.  These approving
statements created such an impression that these commentaries form an
inseparable whole with the text of the Torah.  Therefore it is understandable
with what reverential awe I began to study them.  I had not even a thought of
criticizing or attempting to seek out flaws in them.  My sole aim was to
understand and remember.

Therefore, after beginning to read, I was not even troubled by such immoral
passages where Adam was accused of bestiality with every moving creature until
he was satisfied with Eve.  Or the commentary where Rashi in the parashah about
the flood wrote that when after the flood Noah became drunk and uncovered
himself, Ham either castrated his father, or raped him, or both together.
Such a spectacular conclusion was drawn from the words that Ham saw his father's
nakedness, called his brothers, and for this his descendants were cursed.

However, by reading this passage according to peshat, it is clear that
what actually happened was that the son exposed his father's shame to mockery,
ran to call his brothers, so they could laugh together at their father's disgrace,
i.e., he displayed an extreme degree of disrespect toward parents.  As is
clearly seen, this incident was simply an illustration of the important
commandment to honor parents — Ham's brothers demonstrated how this commandment
should be fulfilled: when they learned what had happened, they approached
without looking at their father, covered him, and for fulfilling the commandment
received a blessing.  But the descendant of the insolent Ham, Canaan, was cursed
for violating this commandment.

But regarding commentaries that defile the memory of ancestors, the question
arises whether such commentaries constitute a manifestation of disrespect toward
ancestors and consequently a violation of the commandment to honor them.  The
same question arises upon reading commentaries asserting that Avimelekh saw all
the intimate details of the patriarchs' and matriarchs' relations, etc.  Do not
such perverted conceptions <!-- (exhibitionism) --> of situations constitute
a sin of disrespect toward ancestors akin to the sin of the moral degenerate
Ham, who mocked his father's nakedness?  Does this not violate the commandment
“Their nakedness you shall not uncover”? <!-- and the corresponding rebuke
of the prophet in Yechezkel [22:10](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.22.10):
“The nakedness of a father they have uncovered in you” -->
(Though in a figurative sense this acquired another meaning as relations
with one's father's wife or concubine, etc.)
<!-- Likewise in Vayikra [18:9](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.18.9)
it is said: “Do not uncover the nakedness of your sister, daughter of your
father or daughter of your mother”, i.e., descent through the father and
mother are equated.  The same equality of father and mother is in Devarim
[27:22](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.27.22): "Cursed be he who lies
with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother".
Also in Vayikra [18:11](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.18.11):
“Do not uncover the nakedness of the daughter of your father's wife —
she is your father's offspring, she is your sister”, i.e., through
the father in any case she is called a sister. -->

Nevertheless, such unbridled comments did not provoke any indignation in me.
Even such immoral acts as the case described in Berakhot
[62a](https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.62a.3), when a student of a rabbi hid
under his teacher's bed and spied on what he was doing with his wife at night,
did not evoke condemnation.  It's possible to find an explanation for such
improper behavior.  Perhaps he wanted to learn how to fulfill the commandment
to be fruitful and multiply.  Or perhaps he wanted to observe
a practical example of using the hole in the sheet
(JT Yevamot [1:1](https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.1.1.6)).
In such cases, it might be agreed that for self-education,
the end justifies the means.  <!-- In the modern world, an analogous act would
be, for example, a violation of copyright, when a paid textbook is illegally
downloaded for free for self-education, etc. -->
“The timid person can not learn”, as Pirkei Avot
[2:5](https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.5) instructs, therefore sometimes
chutzpah is needed to acquire knowledge.  In general, I treated all these cases
of aberrations with tolerance as long as they remained logical and meaningful.

But the turning point came while reading the commentaries after stumbling
upon a completely meaningless and illogical comment.  The last straw
<!-- when quantity transformed into quality, -->
was reading the commentary on the passage from
Beresheet [19:3](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.19.3?with=Rashi),
when before the destruction of Sodom the angels came to Lot, and Lot baked
unleavened bread for them.  It would seem everything was perfectly clear:
Lot was hurrying to feed his guests, and therefore quickly made matzah
in 18 minutes.  In the TaNaKh such cases occur repeatedly: for example,
in Shmuel I [28:24](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.28.24) it is recounted
how due to lack of time bread had to be baked urgently, and matzah resulted.
A similar case was described in Shoftim [6:19](https://www.sefaria.org/Judges.6.19)
etc.  Just as during the hasty Exodus from Egypt there was no time
to prepare leavened bread, so they baked matzah.

But in his commentary on this verse, Rashi wrote utterly absurd words: “It was Pesach”.
Many years remained until the Exodus from Egypt and Pesach, yet Lot already had Pesach!
Like the joke: everywhere else it's Sabbath, but for us it's still Friday.
It resembled a children's game of word associations — one child says “matzah”,
and the other continues by association: “Pesach”.  It was unexpected to receive
such a primitive set of words from an authoritative commentator.
<!-- This is as if a respected author were delivering a serious lecture, and
suddenly in the middle performed an irresponsible stunt — put on a clown's cap
and shouted out: “It was Pesach, hee-hee”.  -->

In modern internet etiquette, this problem is resolved by using emoticons,
which are added to warn that the author intends to entertain the reader with
jokes.  Therefore, it would be understandable if the phrase looked like this:
“It was Pesach ;-)”. <!-- or “LOL” -->  Then everyone would see that the author
is trying to joke, hinting that the comment is not serious, and therefore we
should not take this comment literally.  <!-- In this book, such statements
are placed separately from the main text in comments.  -->
In this case, it would be possible to be more lenient toward such joking.

I could understand it even if the very same comment had been expressed in
slightly different words, for example: “Lot baked matzot, as later done in the
Exodus”.  But instead, it was unequivocally stated that Lot observed a festival
celebrated in honor of the Exodus from Egypt.

I could devise various justifications for this absurd commentary.  Had the
Orthodoxes not rejected me, I would defend the sages against the attacks of
critics, and I would explain this commentary as follows: the word *Pesach*
literally means “passed over”, “passed by” in the sense that G‑d passed over the
Jewish houses when He destroyed the firstborn of Egypt — and in exactly the same
way Lot and his family were saved from destruction when, with the help of the
sent angels, they hastily departed from Sodom.  But the fact remains — in the
form in which it was recorded, this commentary was formulated nonsensically.

After that senseless commentary, it became impossible to take the remaining
commentaries seriously, and I continued to enjoy the contrast between the wisdom
of the Torah and the absurdity of the commentaries.  It affected me like
a contrast shower — the warmth of the Torah alternating with the cold stream of
commentaries: first receiving pleasure (*oneg*) from the warm wise words of the
Torah, which I joyfully read each time as if for the first time, while the
commentaries after each verse were like immersion in a mikveh with ice-cold water.

Such were, for example, statements about teleportation, when Rashi
claimed in his commentary on Beresheet
[28:17](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.28.17?with=Rashi) that Mount Moriah was
transported from Jerusalem to Luz.  Of course, it would be pleasant to fantasize
that in our time the mosques would likewise be transported from Mount Moriah to
Medina.  But unfortunately, this has nothing to do with reality, unlike the
Torah.  The Torah is the truth of life, but midrashim are mere fabrications.
Therefore, that is how we should read them: the Torah with complete
seriousness, and midrashim simply as entertainment.  The Torah is from G‑d —
no author could have written such a brilliant book on his own, whereas
midrashim are human inventions, conceived without prophetic gift.

Such commentaries can appeal only to those for whom the Torah is too boring,
who have grown sated with the Torah — for them such exotic commentaries
work like sharp seasoning added to a bland, inedible dish.  They fail to
understand that the Torah needs no adornment with their meaningless
trinkets, they do not recognize the purity of the Torah without additional
chaff thrown in for good measure.

Here all such midrashic commentaries will not be examined, and such commentaries
constitute the majority, despite the fact that at the very beginning, in his
commentary to Beresheet [3:8](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.8?with=Rashi),
Rashi himself promised to follow strictly the peshat.  But at the same time,
we must acknowledge that Rashi's grammatical observations are presented with
linguistic precision and erudition, which adds contrast with the midrashic
elaborations.  Also not discussed here are Rashi's commentaries on the Talmud,
which help clarify the meaning of what was written by the authors of the Talmud.

It might seem that here I am criticizing such an authoritative and respected
rabbi.  Honestly, it's not me!  His own grandson, having read Rashi's commentary
on the Torah, disputed with his grandfather, reproaching him for departing from
the plain meaning.  And in the end, Rashi acknowledged that he had been wrong,
and that if he had had more time, he would have rewritten his commentary in
accordance with peshat (see Rashbam's commentary on Beresheet
[37:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.37.2?with=Rashbam)).
<!-- Rashbam also criticized his grandfather for anachronisms in the spirit of
“It was Pesach”, such as Rashi's reference to Shimshon when Dan is mentioned
in Beresheet [49:16](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.49.16?with=Rashbam). -->

What does this admission mean?  Rashi was primarily just a compiler.
From the entire vast corpus of texts by his predecessors, for his commentaries
he selected the most shocking.  These days, that's how editors of tabloid and
sensationalist press put together material to entertain their readers.
For example, the commentaries about Adam's bestiality were taken
from Yevamot [63a](https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.63a.5).
The commentaries in the case of Noah were taken
from Sanhedrin [70a](https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.70a.18),
where Rav “castrated” Noah, and Rabbi Shmuel “raped” him.
One commentary “It was Pesach” Rashi simply copied blindly from the midrash
Beresheet Rabbah [48:12](https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.48.12),
and another such commentary on
Beresheet [27:9](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.27.9?with=Rashi)
about how two kids of the goats were needed for Yitzchak's meal
because it was Pesach, Rashi took from Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer
[32](https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.32).

Hence the meaning of Rashi's admission is clear: had he time remaining after
his grandson's remark, he would have supplemented his commentaries with such
references to the texts of predecessors that would more closely correspond to
the plain meaning of the Torah.

Many subsequent commentators attempted to correct this mistake of Rashi, and
therefore approached the interpretation of the text responsibly, striving in
their commentaries to adhere more closely to the peshat.  In my opinion, the
closest adherence to peshat was maintained by the undeservedly undervalued Torah
commentator David Kimchi — Radak.  Like Rashi, he was a great expert in Hebrew
grammar, but his commentaries differed from Rashi's fanciful commentaries in
their greater rationalism, possibly under the influence of Rambam.  Rambam's
influence can also be traced in the commentaries of Joseph ibn Kaspi, who called
for not deviating from the peshat and protested against conclusions that reverse
the meaning of the Torah's words into their opposite.

<!-- Many authors of midrashim lacked conscience, and accordingly lacked the
fear of G‑d.  There are many unconscionable commentaries in the Talmud,
just as there are now many unconscionable comments on social media.
These unconscionable statements migrated from the Talmud into Rashi's
commentaries.  But Radak did have conscience — he is distinguished
by honesty and responsibility in his commentaries. -->

Many of Ramban's commentaries appear as polemics with Rashi.  And the renowned
peshat exegete Ibn Ezra not only criticized the irrationality of Rashi's
commentaries, but even considered midrashim to be interesting for small
children, i.e., as fairy tales.  On the other hand, there is a problem — when
children study aggadic stories, they develop a distorted worldview according
to which these tales are an integral part of the Torah.  Such conflation is
dangerous in that some believe in the truth of both the Torah and the midrashim
simultaneously, while others reject the truth of the midrashim, and then proceed
further, and consequently also reject the truth of the Torah.  But the truth
lies in the middle, therefore maintaining balance<!-- tiferet -->, we must stop
in time: not extend the truth of the Torah to the midrashim, nor the inventions
of the midrashim to the Torah.

Aggadic stories in the Talmud cause no surprise, because there they appear
organically in accordance with the time of the Talmud's composition.  Midrashim
are a rich treasury of Jewish folklore.  But the problem is that often the
additions are not marked in any way.  Therefore it is necessary to explicitly
separate the midrashim from the Torah.  And when mentioning an aggadic tale,
we must always clarify that the story is not from the Torah, so as not to
transgress the commandment not to place a stumbling block before the blind.

<!-- Midrashim have as little in common with the actual stories from the Torah
as film adaptations often have little in common with the events on which they
are based.  That is, midrashim are like works of fantasy, often with a moral. -->

Already in the times of Rambam many refused to accept aggadic stories on faith.
Therefore he had to analyze this problem and draw the following conclusions in
his commentary on Mishnah Sanhedrin
[10](https://www.sefaria.org/Rambam_on_Mishnah_Sanhedrin.10.1.12),
where he divided the readers of aggadot into three groups.

<!-- The Hasidim divide people into only two types: a fool — one
who believes all the tales about tzaddikim, and
[epikoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epikoros) — one
who wholesale rejects their authenticity. -->

In the first (most numerous) group, Rambam included excessively credulous people
who understood all the allegories of the sages literally.  Even when the sages
in midrashim invented incredible tall tales, embedding additional meaning in
them, despite the fact that the events in these stories violated the laws of
nature, such gullible people still understood them in their literal sense,
as if all these surrealistic stories actually occurred in the real world.
Therefore, for members of this group, it is necessary to immediately
provide explanation of their hidden meaning, so that the reader would understand
what exactly the authors had in mind.

To the second (also numerous) group, Rambam assigned all those who considered
the sages to be ignoramuses, believing that the sages wrote these aggadot —
which do not conform to the laws of nature — simply out of foolishness.
Like the first group, members of the second group believed that the
sages intended only the literal meaning.  But unlike the first group, they did
not believe in the scientific reliability of these legends and ridiculed them
in every way.

All the more unsurprising is that many modern readers find such ancient
statements — so distant from contemporary scientific views — laughable.
For example, the website *[Daat Emet](https://daatemet.org.il/en/)* publishes
articles with skeptical analyses of the sages' statements.  I have read articles
from this site, but I did not like their mocking tone — for me it is impossible
to accept such disrespectful treatment of our ancestors.  I believe we must be
more forgiving toward the attempts of ancient peoples to express various
thoughts that concerned them at the time.

The third group according to Rambam consists of those few readers who realize
that the sages did not invent aggadic tales arbitrarily, but rather sought to
embed hidden meaning and moral lessons in their allegorical parables.

Such a classification with regard to aggadah resembles the classification
mentioned in the Passover Haggadah.  Just as Rambam divided people into three
groups, similarly in the Passover Haggadah children are divided into four
groups, the so-called “four sons”:

1. *tam* — simple-hearted, naive, a simpleton;
2. *rasha* — wicked, heretic, evildoer;
3. *eino yodea lishol* — one who does not know how to ask;
4. *chakham* — sage.

If we apply this classification by types of sons to the division into groups
according to their attitude toward the aggadah, we can obtain the following
correspondence:

1. simpletons — they have no questions whatsoever about fantastic stories;
   they silently accept everything literally on faith, i.e., they correspond
   to Rambam's first group;

2. heretics — reject the aggadah, declaring the sages ignorant and foolish,
   i.e., correspond to Rambam's second group;

3. not asking questions, not inquiring —
   without questioning the authority of all past rabbis,
   they simply memorize all their explanations concerning the intended meaning,
   i.e., this is the third group according to Rambam;

4. the wise — they understand what the authors of aggadah wished to convey,
   but at the same time see that not all the stories told came across effectively;
   nevertheless, they regard sympathetically the attempts of their ancestors
   to invent supernatural tales to unfold their thoughts.

Unlike the third group, which believes that all statements of the sages were
truly wise, the members of the even smaller fourth group recognize that
not all predecessors could possess equal abilities.  Even the results of one
author's intellectual labor can vary greatly.  Therefore, it is clear that in
some midrashim deep meaning was successfully conveyed, but not in all.  That is,
the fourth group consists of those who recognize that although the authors
strove to express their thoughts in the form of parables, to add new meaning,
not all attempts were successful.  Different authors achieved this with varying
success, with different degrees of moral content, which is why most midrashim
do not evoke the same admiration as the most brilliant text of the Torah itself.
In fact, the truth as usual lies in the middle: some statements were quite
profound, while others were empty — this must be remembered both by those who
defend absolutely all statements of the sages and by those who criticize them.

Therefore we must avoid extremes, where some believe in all sorts of fairy
tales like the midrashim, while others believe in nothing at all.  The golden
mean <!-- tiferet --> is to believe only in the Torah, interpreting the text in
accordance with contemporary scientific understanding and moral principles.

If we attempt to draw parallels with the modern world, it is easy to notice
that in essence the Talmud is the first social network in history.  Numerous
users/rabbis with an extensive social graph had the ability to exchange
information on the pages of the Talmud, to give likes and leave comments.
And when the Talmud records that one rabbi speaks in the name of
another, this is none other than using the \[Share\] button to repost.

On the other hand, in our time reading the Talmud resembles scrolling through
a social media feed — the same captivating activity as an intellectual game.
So engrossing that it is hard to stop, that you always want to scroll
further to learn something more, the next interesting thoughts and opinions.
Just as a social network has registered users with various backgrounds, and
therefore their posts and comments vary in content, so too in the Talmud the
comments in discussions are uneven in intellectual level, and the halakhic
rulings likewise came from authors of varying levels of ability.
<!-- In his commentary on Mishnah Sanhedrin
[10](https://www.sefaria.org/Rambam_on_Mishnah_Sanhedrin.10.1.1), Rambam
mentioned differences of opinion arising from varying intellectual levels. -->

Just as many consider all Jews intelligent, Orthodoxes consider all
statements of the sages intelligent.  But in reality, just as Jews vary, so too
in the Talmud statements also vary in quality.  Rambam himself in *Moreh Nevukhim*
[3:54](https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_Part_3.54.2) noted that
we should distinguish between experts in law and sages.
{: #sages title="Sages and Erudites"}

Therefore, it is impossible to call every commentator on the Talmud a sage.
When people are undeservedly honored as “sages” merely for diligence and
obedient study of classical works, such self-appointed sages were
denounced by the prophets, for example, Yeshayahu
[5:21](https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.5.21): “Woe unto them that are wise
in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!”
Also Yirmeyahu [8:8-9](https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.8.8-9):
“How can you say: ‘We are wise and the Torah of G‑d is with us’?  But behold, —
the lying pen of the scribes has distorted it.  The wise are put to shame,
they are dismayed and trapped; behold, they have rejected the word of G‑d —
what wisdom is theirs?”

A true sage may be called one to whom the interconnections between the
phenomena of the world and their place on the path of drawing near to G‑d are
clear.  Therefore, they are capable of making profound conclusions that fit
organically into the picture of the world and set the proper direction of
development.

But those rabbis who in the Talmud cemented changes in the laws for ages pursued
only momentary interests, and did not endeavor to lay the foundation for
[sustainable development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development).
Lawmakers who did not foresee the consequences of their decisions in the future
laid a time bomb and became the cause of many modern problems.  For example,
when they decided to remove the law defining Jewishness through the paternal
line, by that ill-considered decision they destroyed more Jews than all the
enemies of the Jewish people, and continue to destroy them by the hands of
present-day rabbis.

About such “sages” it is said in the TaNaKh and Talmud that they lack
the ability to discern the times.  In Nedarim
[20b](https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.20b.10) it was noted that despite the
command in Devarim [1:13](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.1.13):
“Pick wise, discerning, and known men”, later in Devarim
[1:15](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.1.15) it says: “So I took wise and
known men”.  On this basis it was concluded that among the wise and
known, none were found who were discerning.  That is, even the Talmud
acknowledges that a sage may lack discernment.  The discerning here refers
to people of insight who know how to foresee the consequences of their
decisions in the future, of whom it is said in Divrei ha‑yamim I
[12:32](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.12.33) thus: “And of the sons of
Yissakhar, who had understanding of the times”.  This same matter is addressed
in Tamid [32a](https://www.sefaria.org/Tamid.32a.7), that a sage is one who
foresees consequences, i.e., is far-sighted — according to the words of Rabbi
Shimon in Pirkei Avot [2:9](https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.9).

In general, throughout history there were only three greatest Jewish sages
endowed with wisdom and the capacity for profound discerning and understanding
of the times — past, present, and future.  And they were born precisely once
every millennium.

The first sage was King Shlomo.  His great wisdom is known to all
from numerous testimonies preserved in written sources.
In Melakhim I [3:12](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.3.12) it is stated
explicitly that G‑d gave him a wise and discerning mind.

The second great sage appeared a thousand years later and, in addition to
numerous wise rulings, formulated the fundamental principle of human existence:
“What is hateful to you, do not do to another — that is the whole Torah”
(Shabbat [31a](https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.31a.6)).  Many other
manifestations of Hillel's wisdom are also widely known.

The third great sage was born a thousand years later and provided answers to
many theological and philosophical questions.  The inscription on his tomb
reads: “From Moshe to Moshe, there arose no one like Moshe”, referring to
Moshe Rabbeinu and Moshe ben Maimon.  Moshe Rabbeinu was the greatest prophet,
and the title of great sage was earned by the one who comprehended his
prophecies more deeply than all others.

Extrapolating this sequence of the appearance of the greatest sages at 1000-year
intervals, we can calculate that the next great sage will be born 1000 years
after Rambam, i.e., in our time.

And for those rabbis whom it is customary to call sages for their participation
in Talmudic discussions and commentaries, but who lack wisdom, a more precise
definition applies — Talmudic scholars.  Or a more general definition —
erudites.
<!-- Therefore, for example, Rashi is an erudite, while Rambam is a sage. -->

We can say that in erudites only the sefirah of knowledge, Da'at, is filled
to the brim, and to varying degrees the sefirah of understanding, Binah,
<!-- as requested in the blessing before the Shema --> whereas in true sages
all the sefirot are evenly filled: Da'at, Binah, and Chokhmah. <!-- as we must ask
with kavanah in the blessings of the Shmoneh Esrei -->  The sefirah Binah
corresponds to the capacity for deep understanding, the ability to conduct
a comprehensive **analysis** of accumulated knowledge, establishing all
patterns, analogies, and associations.  The sefirah Chokhmah corresponds
to the capacity to draw wise conclusions, to produce a **synthesis**
of reasoned and far-sighted decisions.  In Pirkei Avot
[3:17](https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.3.17) it is said: “If there is no
understanding (i.e., insight into the essence of things), then there is no
knowledge; if there is no knowledge — there is no understanding”.  Indeed,
it is impossible to be wise without accumulating sufficient knowledge
through the sefirah Da'at with deep understanding through the sefirah Binah,
and correspondingly, reasonableness.  On the other hand, the accumulation of
knowledge must always be accompanied by reflection upon the information
received, so that all sefirot are filled evenly — and then it becomes
possible to make wise decisions. <!-- e.g., as King Shlomo -->

In general, a person with an excessive baggage of knowledge rarely has the
ability to draw reasonable conclusions from acquired knowledge.  We can imagine
such an erudite wearing a vest with many little pockets.  And just as this
erudite stuffs various trifles into the vest's pockets, so too does he cram
diverse information into the cells of his brain.  And all these scattered pieces
of knowledge and fragments of accumulated facts lie in the pockets of his brain
as dead weight — disconnected and unsystematic — adding neither reason nor wisdom
to him.  And this is unsurprising — when brain cells are employed to store the data
itself, but not the connections between them, no capacity remains to construct
logical conclusions based on remembered facts.  Having snatched up random
information and crammed it into all the free cells of the brain, one loses the
possibility of analyzing the acquired volumes of what remains useless knowledge.
In this case, people are capable only of blindly repeating all received
information and unquestioningly executing all memorized instructions like
computers.

Such erudition resembles how legendary mnemonists under the pseudonym
[Shas Pollak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shas_Pollak) and other individuals
possessed such photographic memory that they remembered the placement of all
words on all ≈5000 pages of the Talmud so that by piercing any tractate with
a pin, they could name all the words through which the needle passed on each
page.  But none of them could find a more useful application for the memorized texts.
<!-- Such phenomenal memory is very rare — very few such mnemonists
are known, like Shereshevsky in Luria's studies in
*[The Mind of a Mnemonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Shereshevsky)*.  -->

This shows that the most essential requirement for memorizing the numerous laws
of Halakha is to have a good memory.  And this was an enormous problem for me,
because I have an exceptionally poor memory.
<!-- I remember when I started learning Hebrew, I spent several weeks just
studying the alphabet.  And learned words are quickly forgotten — for example,
despite having celebrated Hanukkah many times, there were occasions when
I could not recall the name of the holiday. -->
When studying Halakha, I had difficulties memorizing details:
I have an associative memory, while many details of Halakha have no logic,
so one must memorize various details by rote.
<!-- It was especially difficult to memorize tables, including food additives —
it was like trying to memorize trigonometric tables. -->
For example, if the volume of a product exceeds the size of a knife by 60 times,
then only 2 centimeters of the surface layer absorbs taste from the knife.
The thickness of the layer to be cut away, measured to the nearest centimeter,
is not derived from the Torah, therefore mechanical memorization is required.
Or why one must stab a meat knife in the ground precisely 10 times to make it
permissible for cutting bread during a dairy meal.  Likewise, the number of
hours — that after meat before dairy one must wait 6 hours — is not derived
from the Torah.

When I studied higher mathematics at university, it was very easy to remember
the proofs of mathematical theorems, since one theorem necessarily followed from
other theorems and axioms in accordance with mathematical logic.  For example,
here is a notable case: instead of attending mathematics lectures, I spent
all my time at the computer in the university's computer lab, so three exams
in higher mathematics have piled up unfinished for me.  I put it off until
the very last moment, and to take advantage of the last opportunity,
I had to spend three days preparing for all three exams at once — in three days
I learned the entire course of higher mathematics.  What helped me was that
in preparing for the exams, I did not cram, i.e., did not rely on mechanical
memorization, but delved into the meaning.  And only after gaining complete
understanding of the logic was there no longer any need to burden my memory with
literal memorization of the words of the proof.  Thus I successfully passed all
three exams in succession, one after another, in a single day over 6 hours from
morning to evening, spending 2 hours on each written exam.  And all thanks to
the fact that having remembered the general logic of the proofs, I could
reconstruct the course of each proof simply by following the logic.

This example clearly illustrates how Da'at, Binah, and Chokhmah differ.  When
a student merely memorizes the proof of a theorem, only the sefirah Da'at is
engaged.  When a student understands the proof so deeply that there is no need
to memorize it word for word, and then during the exam reconstructs the proof
based on the understanding formed, the sefirah Binah is engaged.  And the
sefirah Chokhmah is rarely engaged by students — but it does happen that
students who later become outstanding scientists are capable of deriving proofs
on their own.  I was certainly not capable of devising mathematical proofs,
but in programming I devise new ways to solve people's problems every day
(except the Sabbath).  However, filling the sefirah Chokhmah should not be
limited to programming alone — it is simply what I do best.  In general,
the sefirah Chokhmah become filled when you actively engage in finding
solutions to the problems of any person in all aspects of life.

Just as I once hurried to prepare for a higher mathematics exam,
so too in yeshiva, when I diligently studied the 190-page textbook
“Meat and Dairy: An Illustrated Halachic Guide”, I rushed to learn
everything quickly, so they would perform the necessary circumcision
for me urgently.  But I could not understand where all these numbers
and formulas came from, which made them difficult to memorize.
<!-- “Exams are approaching, but everything is incomprehensible”. -->
Moreover, I discovered an error in the formulas for calculating
pot wall thickness, meant to ensure that the absorbed flavor
would be less than one-sixtieth of the pot's contents.
<!-- πHX² was missing from the formula for P₂ -->
Yet if an error crept into the calculations, then all results are worthless,
and the commandment is violated by the Orthodoxes in the most egregious manner.
Just as Kabbalah is called a science, so too Orthodox Judaism has been made into
an exact science, where precision of observance is verified by scientific
methods.  Only the standards were chosen arbitrarily — unlike physics and
mathematics, where precise values were set by G‑d.

Generally, when studying halakhic literature, it was difficult to find any logic
in the halakhic conclusions, so there were problems with memorizing the rules.
The laws of the Written Torah are well remembered through association with
instructive stories, but the disconnected laws of Halakhah are difficult to
commit to memory.  Nevertheless, I still diligently memorized everything
I read in numerous textbooks.  And only after the Orthodoxes rejected me
did I begin to ponder where such enormous volumes of halakhic laws came from.

<!-- For example, one of the questions studied in yeshivot: “Is it permissible
on the Sabbath to wipe oneself with stones while sitting on a neighbor's plowed
field” (KSA [80:75](https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Arukh.80.75) etc.).
No, I was not at all outraged by the seemingly absurd formulation of the
question — the desire was clear to cover all possible even hypothetical
situations, to regulate behavior in the minutest detail in absolutely all
possible cases that arise in life.  But the problem is that for all these
questions of conduct in each case there cannot exist an unambiguous answer
that would be derived from the traditional 39 melakhot.  And indeed, in many
cases Halakha is forced to acknowledge that some rabbis think one way,
and others differently.  In short, complete bardak and balagan. -->

<!--
I previously studied the Kitzur Shulchan Arukh diligently, read it several
times, and never once thought to question the laws set forth therein.
Even when some at the yeshiva dismissively waved their hand at the
Kitzur Shulchan Arukh and said that it was all hopelessly outdated,
I did not want to agree with such opinions.
{: #ocd title="OCD"}

And only after the Orthodoxes rejected me, treated me heartlessly,
did I begin to examine the reasons, and then I started critically
rereading halakhic literature.

In general, if one analyzes impartially the content of the requirements of the
Shulchan Arukh code, one can notice that it is essentially a collection of
medieval superstitions.

For example, consider the chapter
Kitzur Shulchan Arukh [162:10](https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Arukh.162.10).
There is brought the following law that upon leaving the mikvah
a woman should ensure that the first one to touch her would be
her friend, so that it should not happen that the first
thing she sees is something unclean: a dog, a donkey, a pig,
an *am ha‑aretz* (an unlearned Jew), or a non-Jew.
If upon leaving the mikvah she saw any of the above,
she must immerse again.  And so repeat until the nerves calm down.

What does this resemble?  Undoubtedly, these are typical symptoms
of a nervous disorder
[OCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive–compulsive_disorder) —
obsessive-compulsive disorder, also known as obsessional neurosis.

In this neurosis, to relieve nervous tension a person needs to get the feeling
that routine actions have been performed “perfectly”, i.e., in such a way that
the person experiences a feeling of satisfaction replacing the sense of anxiety.
Often achieving such a “perfect outcome” requires several attempts.  An attempt
is considered “unsuccessful” when it does not proceed as flawlessly as desired,
when some insignificant interference creates a feeling of discomfort.

For example, symptoms of OCD manifest when a mistake is made in prayer —
and because of this they recite everything from the beginning.  Or they put on
shoes in a particular order, etc.  In general, once a habit is formed of doing
something in a certain way, then it is difficult to rid oneself of it later.
This is also closely related to an excessive tendency toward
[perfectionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionism_(psychology)).

Frankly speaking, all of this is a manifestation of religious feeling.
The general pattern is that one subconsciously sets oneself the task of
performing certain actions with the rationale that if one does this in an ideal
manner, one will receive a reward for it.  Such hope often arises in people
who have many problems, and for them the last resort is to believe that if
they perform “correctly” the rituals they themselves have invented, all
their problems will magically resolve themselves, because it might suddenly
turn out that G‑d requires precisely all these even insignificant actions.
On the other hand, it is impossible to abandon performing the rituals
out of fear of subsequent punishment.

This aspect was examined in detail by Freud in his work *Obsessive Actions and
Religious Practices* (1907).  He defines neurosis as individual religiosity, and
religion as a shared neurotic obsession.  Quote: “the petty ceremonials of
religious practice gradually become the essential thing and push aside the
underlying thoughts.  That is why religions are subject to reforms which work
retroactively and aim at a reestablishment of the original balance of values”.
It is quite reasonable to agree that many customs and stringencies of the Orthodoxes
are symptoms of neurosis, codified in laws that supplant the original moral meaning
of the commandments.

But these are mainly personal quirks of religion's followers.  Worse is when
symptoms of autism manifest in attitudes toward other people — and then the
capacity for compassion disappears.  And indeed, many Orthodoxes behave like
autistics who lack empathy and are incapable of sympathizing with other people.
Here it is not accidentally said that they are not autistics, but like autistics
— because autistics cannot help their autism, whereas Orthodoxes consciously
choose insensitivity and indifference to the suffering of others, i.e., this is
a moral problem.
-->

| in these commandments, which I command you today, there is nothing incomprehensible or inaccessible |
| (Devarim [30:11-14](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.30.11-14)) |
{: .chapter #addition title="Addition of Commandments"}

“There is nothing incomprehensible” — this means that the Torah assumes there
can arise no two opinions regarding the details of fulfilling the commandments,
because the commandments must be performed strictly according to what is written
in the Torah as understood by everyone, i.e., according to the plain sense, peshat.
Yet the entire history of the development of Orthodox Judaism demonstrates the
exact opposite of this principle: there are as many opinions as there are Jews,
and often even more: two Jews, three opinions.
Hence the pairs of legal authorities *zugot*, the numerous disputes on the pages
of the Talmud, and even there were two Talmuds: the Jerusalem and the Babylonian.
Therefore the interpretation of the Torah must correspond to the
requirements of modernity, which resolved contradictions in the past.

“There is nothing inaccessible” — this means that there should be no
difficulties in fulfilling the commandments.  But the Orthodoxes have burdened
people with so many stringencies that they have made the fulfillment of the
commandments inaccessible, which is why many Jews have fled from Judaism.
<!-- For example, it was inaccessible for me to cook chicken, so I had
to buy ready-made food.  --> And I wanted to observe all the Orthodox
stringencies, but I could not.  Just as the Orthodoxes themselves —
they want to build the Temple, but they cannot.

| When you build a new house, make a parapet for your roof, so that you do not bring bloodguilt upon your house if anyone should fall from it. |
| (Devarim [22:8](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.22.8)) |
{: .chapter}

This is one of the clearest examples of how Orthodoxes completely ignore the
plain meaning of Torah, adding instead new laws that derive Halakhah from drash.

The commandment to build a parapet is a commandment of safety precautions.
But the Orthodoxes have completely perverted the meaning of this commandment,
and use it to justify their invented stringencies to build a “fence around the
Torah”.  And while all normal students study safety procedures in educational
institutions, which also include methods of providing first aid, etc., instead
the Orthodoxes memorize justifications for their stringencies.

Yet they do not observe one of the most urgent commandments of our time.
And therefore, for example, they do not care for safety when organizing
mass gatherings, and as a result such terrible events occur as the
[crowd crush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Meron_crowd_crush) on Mount Meron.
This is the most terrible punishment, when for the Orthodoxes' failure to
observe the commandments of the Torah, the direct violation of the commandment
to build a fence around danger brings human sacrifices.  But instead of caring
for the preservation of life, the Orthodoxes seek the causes of tragedies in
insufficient observance of their stringencies, in insufficiently careful washing
of hands before eating, in insufficient concentration when reciting blessings,
etc. — anything whatsoever, except the real cause, despite the fact that the
meaning of this commandment was known even in the times of the Temple, where
even with a million-strong gathering of people it was never crowded.

Here no condemnation is made of the very practice of regularly visiting graves
of the righteous, though veneration of rabbis resembles idolatry.  I respect
pilgrims who travel to the graves of the righteous — I myself dreamed of
visiting all these places.  I respect even more the righteous who are buried
there.  But I must acknowledge that veneration even of the greatest righteous,
worshiping their graves as idols and other cultic sites, moreover with the
kindling of bonfires as among pagans, is akin to idolatry leading to human
sacrifice.  This resembles how people once worshiped
[Nehushtan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehushtan) — the bronze serpent
crafted by Moshe, until King Chizkiyahu destroyed this object of worship that
had become an idol.  As formerly during festivals the people would stream to the
Temple to worship G‑d, so now Orthodoxes have replaced this with veneration of
authorities as idols.  This is genuine personality cult, when one's leader is
regarded as Mashiach, or when people worship his worn “holy” pants.

| You shall not add to what I command you, nor shall you remove from it |
| (Devarim [4:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.4.2)) |

| Everything that I command you, observe to do; do not add to it nor remove from it. |

| Add nothing to His words, lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. |
| (Mishlei [30:6](https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.30.6)) |

To divert suspicion of violating this commandment, the Orthodoxes explain that
it is only forbidden to change the quantity of certain objects, e.g., five
passages in the tefillin instead of four, five species of plants with the lulav
instead of four, five tzitzit fringes on the corners of the tallit instead of
four, etc.  But even if one accepts such a limited understanding regarding the
prohibition only of quantitative changes, and not addition of stringencies,
then still numerous violations occur even in this regard.

For example, the Torah gives the commandment of the Seder on the night of the
14th of Nisan.  But the Orthodoxes in the Diaspora add a second Seder on the
15th of Nisan as well, and not on Pesach Sheni, not on the second Passover
ordained by the Torah on the 14th of Iyar.  Also it is said, “Seven days you
shall eat unleavened bread”, not eight.  And other festivals are also
duplicated, and additional festival days are added.  When in Eretz Yisrael there
is one schedule of festivals and Torah readings, and outside Eretz Yisrael
another, this splits the unity between the Jews of Israel and the Diaspora —
as if in one community each person prayed at home at a different time.

But the people could not have endured fasting on Yom Kippur two days in a row.
There were other attempts to introduce inhumane stringencies as well.
For example, the Talmud states that after the destruction of the Temple, rabbis
wanted to prohibit marriage altogether, but limited themselves to only certain
periods of the year.  There were also plans to completely forbid the consumption
of meat and wine (Bava Batra [60b](https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.60b.11)).
Because only men suffer for several days after circumcision, they wanted to
artificially add numerous sufferings to women as well — and to require women
to fast for an entire month during the process of conversion.  Had all these
sadistic stringencies been adopted, it would now be claimed that all of this was
given orally at Sinai.

Further examples of the increase in the number of commandments.  The Torah gives
the commandment prohibiting the consumption of leavened bread during Passover
(*chametz*), i.e., fermentable grain products: wheat, rye, barley, oats, spelt.
Yet the Shulchan Arukh adds a new commandment prohibiting the consumption of
*kitniyot*, which includes various types of legumes and products made from them,
including a ban on peas, beans, peanuts, soy, sunflower seeds, buckwheat, hemp,
chickpeas — consequently hummus and falafel are forbidden, as well as rice and
rice cakes, corn and cornflakes, plus numerous other plant crops and products.
Also among Ashkenazim, non-legumes are forbidden during Passover: dried fruits
such as raisins, figs, dried orange peels, certain vegetables such as radish and
garlic, mustard from the cabbage family, and Hasidim avoid sugar.  Pickles in
which unverified salt was used also are not consumed.  According to some opinions,
even potatoes are included in the prohibition.

This is one of the most egregious examples where stringency reached the point of
direct violation of Torah law, when to the commandment forbidding leavened bread
were added commandments forbidding all manner of other types of food — despite
the fact that the same Shulchan Arukh forbids imposing additional restrictions
upon oneself.  This prohibition is not a custom, but precisely a new rabbinic
law.  Customs are optional to observe, a custom can easily be annulled.
<!-- Customs are usually for pleasure, not a burden, like imposed restrictions. -->
But kitniyot can no longer be annulled for Ashkenazim.  There is no going back —
the custom has turned into law, binding for observance, and any attempts to
annul it or even slightly ease it will be perceived as Reform.
<!-- This is also an example of radicalization. -->

At the end of the Laws of Vows
[13:25](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Vows.13.25)
Rambam cited tractate Nedarim [60b](https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.60b.3),
where it is stated that one who takes upon himself vows, i.e., additional stringencies,
is like one who has built a personal altar during the time when the Temple stands,
by analogy: the Temple is the Torah, and the altar is additional stringencies.

In Megillat Esther a non-Jewish custom was described whereby the king's decrees
cannot be revoked, and only new laws can be issued on top of the old ones.
In exactly the same way it is customary among the Orthodoxes, when adopted laws
are not repealed, but new ones are layered on top of them. <!-- like patches -->

Such an accumulation of halakhic stringencies resembles
a [house of cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_cards), where
the cards of later authorities are placed upon the cards of earlier authorities,
such that it becomes impossible to correct the conclusions of the earlier ones —
just as it is impossible to pull out and replace even a single card from the
middle.  When even one rabbi at the foundation of the pyramid has erred, it
becomes impossible to correct his error without the collapse of the entire
structure.  Therefore, one can only pile on top ever new stringencies, until the
structure collapses under its own weight, and everyone scatters in different
directions.

Another analogy is a
[black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon#Event_horizon_of_a_black_hole).
The closer one gets to a black hole, the stronger the pull into the hole from which
there is no escape.  Falling into the hole is easy, requiring no energy whatsoever,
and each new stringency pulls one deeper and deeper.
Just as added commandments can no longer be abolished — for example, it is impossible
to abolish the new commandment forbidding *kitniyot* — so too it is impossible
to climb back out of the hole.  Therefore there is no way back —
all that remains is to continue falling.

Whence comes this rabbinic compulsion to invent stringencies?  The problem is
that stringencies were invented by rabbis for whom this is their primary
occupation.  All the stringencies of the Orthodoxes arose as a result of
[professional deformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_deformation)
among rabbis.  Due to professional deformation, rabbis added complications based
on their own lives, in which they occupied themselves solely with Talmud study.
<!-- so that they would not be too bored -->  At the same time, they were not
bound by other obligations, as most working people are, and therefore gave no
consideration to the capacities and needs of ordinary people.  That is, rabbis,
having no concerns of the daily life of working people, constantly pondered:
“What else might we devise to complicate the lives of Jews”, as antisemites do.
As upon slaves, so upon working people they loaded an additional burden of
stringencies, such that many could not endure and scattered.  Thus with the
self-imposed burden of stringencies, the Orthodoxes destroy Judaism,
repelling the majority. <!-- and thereby preventing the restoration of the Temple -->

The rabbis have created such a convoluted system that only they themselves
are experts, and they demand that everyone learn from them to also become experts,
abandoning all other pursuits.
The Orthodoxes constantly raise the bar of observance higher and higher, so that
for most people the height becomes inaccessible, since it is impossible to spend
the greater part of one's time following all the additions, and therefore the
majority are forced to abandon Judaism altogether — thus the Orthodoxes are
destroying Judaism.

<!-- This resembles an overly complex programming language — for the authors,
adding new features was a natural process, but for newcomers it only causes
incomprehension regarding the purpose of many language constructs.

And now the situation resembles the state of affairs in many financial
institutions that still use COBOL on mainframes.  (BTW, in the early 1990s
I implemented a core-function library for a well-known COBOL compiler
development company — since then I've retained a deep aversion to that
pseudo-language.)  And just as it is very difficult to rewrite existing
functions in more modern programming languages because of the enormous number
of interconnected details, so too is it difficult to update traditions —
for social reasons. -->

There are also examples of simultaneous addition and subtraction — during the
reform transitioning the determination of Jewish identity from the paternal line
to the maternal line in the Talmudic period, they subtracted from the law of the
Torah, which teaches that Jewish identity is transmitted through the father, and
in place of that law added a new law of transmission of Jewish identity through
the mother.  Often in the Torah, counter-examples of improper behavior are first
given, and then a law explicitly prohibiting such behavior is prescribed.
For example, before the giving of the Torah, counter-examples were given of
relations with close relatives, and then the Torah unambiguously forbade such
perversions.  In contrast to this, before the giving of the Torah the
transmission of Jewish identity through the father was practiced, which is
mentioned repeatedly in the narrative portion of the Torah, but in the
legislative portion this law was not explicitly annulled — after the giving of
the Torah an opposite law was not explicitly given that would introduce
a new principle of determining Jewish identity through the mother.
And only much later was Jewish identity through the mother added to Halakhah,
contradicting the Torah.

Since the Torah explicitly gave a law forbidding additions, there must also be
counterexamples showing how violation of the prohibition against adding caused
negative consequences.  And indeed, such examples exist: at the very beginning
of the book of Beresheet, we are told how G‑d gave Adam a single prohibitory
commandment — the prohibition against eating from the tree of knowledge in Gan Eden.
After Chavah's appearance, Adam conveyed this commandment to her, but in doing
so added an additional stringency: also not to touch the tree, lest they die.
That is, Adam committed precisely the transgression against which the Torah
warns with its prohibition against adding to G‑d's commands.  Like the
Orthodoxes, Adam wanted to erect an additional “fence” around the prohibition
against eating from the tree, so that Chavah would not even desire to touch the
tree.  And then the inevitable punishment for erecting a “fence” followed: the
serpent pushed Chavah toward the tree so that she touched it — she saw that
nothing bad happened from violating the stringency, and then concluded that if
she ate from the tree, no punishment would follow either.  But the punishment
for violating the actual prohibition was very severe — its consequences continue
to bring suffering to people to this day.  Thus stringencies lead to catastrophe.

<!-- BTW, this also shows that oral transmission of information is unreliable —
had this commandment been written down, Chavah would not have transgressed it. -->

It is no coincidence that
[Sefer HaBahir](https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaBahir.200) concludes with
the instruction: “whoever adds, diminishes”.  So too the Orthodoxes add
stringencies — and thereby diminish the number of observant people.

This teaches what harm is caused by stringencies that lead to violation of the
commandment of addition, when the fence buries under its weight that which it
was meant to protect.  Over 2000 years, walls so high were erected around the
Torah and it was surrounded by dense rows of fences with barbed wire, that as
a result Judaism was transformed into a dark ghetto.  <!-- They fell into
slavery to rabbis who oppressed and burdened them with stringencies. -->
Therefore it is no wonder that in the end many could not endure the confinement,
and at the first opportunity the majority of Jews went forth
<!-- from slavery --> into freedom.

Following the tradition of shifting blame onto others, some Orthodoxes claim
that as punishment for many Jews having departed from Judaism, they were
destroyed during the Holocaust.  And they shift the blame for the departure from
Judaism onto the Reformists and directly accuse the Reformists of the Holocaust.

But these are false accusations, and I know this for certain from the example
of my own ancestors.

My great-great-grandfather Shimshon ben Mordechai (Samson Mordkovich)
and great-great-grandmother Pesya Yosifovna (– 25.07.1925 ז״ל)
were fully observant Jews.

</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="../../../files/book/linkova_pesia.jpg" alt="[Linkova Pesia]" />
  <figcaption>Great-great-grandmother Pesya</figcaption>
</figure>

But their six sons <!-- and four daughters --> were all completely secular.
And there were no Reformists anywhere near at that time.
But still they themselves and their children remained loyal to the Jewish people —
my grandfather married a Jewish woman.
And it was not his fault that she was killed during the Holocaust.
<!-- And after the war, my grandfather traveled to Cherkasy and there received
forgiveness from the rabbis for having been forced, after losing his Jewish
wife, to violate his faithfulness to the Jewish people through no fault of his own. -->
<!-- Thus, unlike the present-day descendants of Holocaust survivors,
my ancestors were killed during the Holocaust. -->

In reality, the task of the Reformists was not to dissuade the Orthodoxes from
observance, but on the contrary — to stop the departure of Jews from Judaism,
to bring back to the fold of Judaism those Jews who were drifting away from
Judaism, who could not bear the burden of numerous stringencies, to return them
to original Judaism without artificially added burdensome stringencies,
Judaism responsive to human needs.

As in the case in the Garden of Eden, when Adam shifted the blame onto his wife,
whom he had burdened with stringencies, so too some Orthodoxes blame the victims
of their stringencies for the Holocaust.

Moreover, just as Adam accused G‑d, so too do they accuse G‑d regarding the
Shoah, following the example of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, who based on one
altered letter of the Torah accused G‑d of not protecting Abel from Cain,
of not saving him from death (Beresheet Rabbah
[22:9](https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.22.9)).

But on the other hand, just as Chavah blamed only the serpent, who was
associated with Satan, so too we must denounce only actual evildoers
who have succumbed to Satan's influence.

As seen in Shemot [7:3](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.7.3), initially G‑d
personally subjected a person to trials when He hardened Pharaoh's heart,
i.e. placed in Pharaoh's mind the thought not to let the Jews go.  But Pharaoh
retained free will.  Knowing Pharaoh's character and his inclinations, G‑d was
certain that Pharaoh would incline toward the decision not to let the Jews go.
<!-- See also Sihon, king of Heshbon
in Devarim [2:30](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.2.30). -->
But punishment followed, because Pharaoh retained the possibility of not
yielding to negative thoughts, and the Egyptian people retained the possibility
of not obeying Pharaoh's commands.  As it was said in Beresheet
[15:14](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.15.14), the nation that enslaves
will be subjected to judgment.

Later the function of instilling evil thoughts to test a person was taken on
by the satan.  As already mentioned above, the satan often implants various
criminal thoughts into the neurons of the brain.  But a person always retains
free will to resist evil impulses, and accordingly, always retains
responsibility for their actions.  However, not everyone passes such trials.
The German Führer and all Nazi criminals possessed free will
<!-- but not in the sense of will according to Nietzsche and Wagner -->
and the possibility of not obeying the satan's commands.  Had the Germans
refused to submit to the satan, then the satan would have tried to incline other
nations.  But many Germans and their accomplices chose not to refuse committing
crimes at the satan's instigation, and therefore bore responsibility for their
atrocities.

| Blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.  Do not forget! |
| (Devarim [25:17-19](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.25.17-19)) |
{: .chapter #antisemitism title="Antisemitism"}

The word *amalek* from a proper noun became a common noun — with a lowercase
letter, as the ideological heir of the Amalekites.  Just as *agag* was the title
of Amalekite kings, so *amalek* became synonymous with antisemite.  There have
been many amaleks in history: amaleks attempted to destroy the Jews not only
during the Exodus, but also during Purim, and during the Holocaust.  But unlike
the Exodus and Purim, when a savior was found, in the last case the tragedy is
that there was no one like Moshe who
in accordance with Yirmeyahu [16:14-15](https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.16.14-15)
and [23:7-8](https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.23.7-8)
would lead the Jews out of Germany and Europe altogether into Israel.
<!-- And the Orthodoxes even opposed, rejecting Zionism. -->

Following the commandment to blot out the memory of Amalek, I endeavor not to
mention the names of amaleks — just as the name of the Egyptian Pharaoh was
not mentioned, so too the name of the German Führer should not be mentioned.
<!-- For the same reason, it is unpleasant when photographs of antisemitic
criminals are displayed. -->

<!-- If the prohibition were not followed, it would become analogous to the
[Streisand effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect),
when instead of erasure, it is constantly repeated even more. -->

<!-- BTW, to avoid misunderstandings, it should be clarified that
unlike evildoers such as Amalek, this book also does not mention the names
of many good people, but for the completely opposite reason: alongside
a great number of their good deeds, they also have minor flaws — therefore,
without mention of their names, the Satan has no foothold to accuse them even
in small matters. -->

But ultimately Amalek will be forgotten naturally once all causes leading to
hatred and enmity completely disappear.  Therefore, the commandment to blot out
the memory of Amalek will be fulfilled in the process of achieving this goal.

Amalek was one of the first antisemites, who attacked the Jews without objective cause.
Antisemites have only subjective reasons stemming from their evil inclinations.
Here is an incomplete list of personal problems that come out in antisemitism:

- Inferiority complex.  Some understand the phrase “G‑d's chosen people” not
as a task assigned to the Jewish people to bring the world closer to G‑d,
often through immense loss and suffering.  Instead, they understand
[chosenness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews_as_the_chosen_people)
not as an obligation, but as a privilege — as a declaration of being “superior
people”, the “world elite”.  Attributing superiority to others evokes a sense
of one's own inferiority.  To avoid such a feeling, one must understand that
regardless of nationality, every person has the task of developing their soul.
Therefore, when a person performs any good deed, that person rises higher than
one who merely considers himself chosen but does nothing to improve the world.
The ultimate goal of humanity's existence is achieving equality among people,
however, not as equally spiritually impoverished, but rather with an equally
high level of soul development.

- Compensation for one's own deficiencies.  When someone is in slavish
submission to authorities and lacks freedom, they invent conspiracy theories
that accuse Jews of enslaving nations and exercising power over the world.
<!-- Antisemites are so certain that Jews control everything, but in truth G‑d
governs all, and the distinction of the Jewish people from other nations is that
G‑d first revealed Himself to the Jewish people and set before the Jews certain
tasks, which throughout the centuries they have fulfilled with varying success. -->
Instead, they must fight against their own authorities to establish democracy
and equal opportunities in their own country.  When someone experiences material
hardship and lacks money, they suspect that all Jews are too wealthy.
The only solution here is to develop society such that a person receives
proper compensation for their labor.  And when a person considers themselves
insufficiently intelligent, envy arises: some become convinced that all Jews
are clever, successful, that everything works out for them — this provokes envy.
Especially when a person is certain that members of their own people are
deficient in intelligence.  But no nation is inherently more intelligent or more
stupid than another.  One of the most telling examples: North and South Korea.
<!-- BTW, North Korea is not actually ruled by the leader, but by
a military junta that firmly controls the nominal leaders, who vividly
illustrate the expression “dumb and dumber”. -->
While North Korea in terms of living standards remains in the Stone Age, South
Korea is among the most successful countries, improving the lives of millions of
people throughout the world — yet genetically they are one people with identical
capabilities.  Therefore, every person has the opportunity to raise their
intellectual level — for this, one must study diligently.  That same South Korea
is among the world's leaders in quality of education, on par with Israel.
<!-- Also the successes of South Korea may also be connected to constant
existential threats, struggle for survival, and accordingly the aspiration
to position itself as an indispensable participant in humanity's progress,
much like Israel, Ukraine, and Estonia.  -->

- Resistance to progress and the development of humanity.  At the very bottom of
society there are always such savages who drag humanity back into the past.
They strive to preserve a primitive state with the justification that animals
experience neither moral discomfort nor pangs of conscience.  They envy animals,
who lack the moral obligations with which G‑d has endowed human beings.
Therefore they wish to lead a completely animal existence, having only a minimum
of concerns: obtaining food, reproduction, and seizing neighboring territories —
that is, the entire limited set of actions performed even by bacteria and simple
microorganisms.  It is no wonder that such single-celled beings hate Jews — they
consider it evil that Jews, by their very existence, pull people out of
an animal state toward the light.

- Personal grievances against G‑d for problems in one's life, and consequently
the desire to take revenge on G‑d.  Often people become antisemites when
something goes wrong in life, when failures pursue them — and then resentment
toward G‑d may arise.  And since it is believed that Jews have a special
connection with G‑d, by venting their rage on Jews, they think they are
indirectly avenging themselves on G‑d for their failed lives.  Since they cannot
reach G‑d, they vent their grievances on those they consider G‑d's
representatives on Earth.  Even unbelievers and atheists subconsciously harbor
the thought of Jewish connection to G‑d, and therefore blame them for their own
misfortunes.  But they must realize that often the source of problems is the
satan.  Therefore everyone must strive to suppress the influence of the satan.

- National grievances.  For example, the Nazis appealed to the terms of the
[Treaty of Versailles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles),
and as a result directed the people's bitterness toward defenseless Jews.
Or in so-called [Third World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World)
countries (the very name hints at third-rate status), in
[developing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country)
countries (and this name hints at underdevelopment), whose populations eke out
a miserable existence, there is resentment over the low level of societal
development, over their failure to build decent states in which human rights
are respected.  Such countries constitute the majority in the UN.  But this
resentment diminishes as a society's prosperity increases, and accordingly,
antisemitism decreases in developed societies.  For example, oil trade revenues
allowed the living standards of the populations of Arabian Peninsula countries
to rise substantially, and with the achievement of economic prosperity, the
level of antisemitism consequently decreased.  And now in the enriched Arabian
Peninsula countries, the decrease in antisemitism has led to the signing of the
[Abraham Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Accords)
normalizing relations between Israel and four Arab countries,
including the UAE.  Therefore the overall trend is such that the level of
antisemitism decreases in those countries whose inhabitants have freedom and
democracy.  Also in countries with a high standard of living and a predominant
middle class, when increased material prosperity brings greater overall life
satisfaction, which fosters the emergence of self-respect — and consequently
respect for others.  As it is written
in Yirmeyahu [29:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.29.7):
“And seek the welfare of the city to which I have exiled you, and pray
to the L‑rd in its behalf, for in its prosperity you shall prosper”.

- Antisemitic propaganda that incites hatred toward the Jews.
This includes the “Protocols of the Elders of Zion”, “Mein Kampf”,
and other Judeophobic fabrications.

Anti-Israel propaganda is one form of antisemitism.  It must be distinguished
from constructive criticism of Israel, where no less criticism is directed
proportionally at other parties to the conflict and at other countries having no
fewer criticized defects.  Thus, criticizing Israel's actions toward Arabs is
permissible only in parallel with criticizing Arab countries' treatment of Jews
living there — if Jews were expelled from those countries, then critics have no
right to speak.  Or when terrorists attack Israel's civilian population, those
who do not condemn the terror attacks have no right to criticize Israel's
retaliatory measures.  Likewise, those who do not condemn the actions of
authoritarian governments oppressing other nations — for example, such as the
Kurds, etc. — have no right to criticize.  Therefore, only one who also demands the
establishment of a State of Kurdistan for the Kurds may support the
establishment of a Palestinian state.  But such bias with double standards, where
no one cares what Arabs and authoritarian regimes do to other nations, yet at the
same time condemn Jews for defending themselves against terrorist attacks — this
is genuine antisemitism.

In general, there is a simple rule: if only the actions of Israel spark outrage,
then such a bias is a sign of antisemitism.  When at any mention of Israel one
immediately thinks of the Palestinians, this is latent antisemitism.  And when
sympathies lie entirely with the terrorists — this is authentic antisemitism.

The methods of conducting antisemitic propaganda do not differ significantly.
Here are two of the most striking examples that stuck with me most from childhood:

1. In the early 1980s, I read an article in a Soviet journal condemning Israel
during the Lebanon conflict.  At the very end of the article, the correspondent
vividly described how on a Beirut street an Arab fighter raised his hand with
fingers spread in the form of the V symbol, signifying
[Victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_sign).  At that time I did
not yet know all the details of the Middle Eastern conflict — I wanted first
to understand the situation impartially for myself based on all the facts,
and until then had not decided which side to take.  But this beautiful gesture
captivated me, and a desire arose to emulate it.

2. In the early 1990s I read an illustrated article in a Western European
magazine about the demolition of Israeli settlements, and one photograph
showed a joyful Arab elder with a wide smile on his toothless mouth —
in front of the ruins of Jewish settlements demolished by bulldozer.
The obvious purpose of publishing this photograph was to arouse sympathy for
one side of the conflict.  At that time I was already firmly on Israel's side
after the attacks by Soviet rockets from Iraq in 1991.  But still doubts
remained whether it's possible to achieve peace in exchange for land —
at that time my relatives from Israel were sending letters expressing hope
for peace with the Arabs, even at the price of territorial concessions.
<!-- They also sent homemade poetry books on this theme, where
the title page was at the end of the book, as in Hebrew. -->
And so this staged photograph nudged to incline opinion in favor of
one side of the conflict.

Comparing these examples and analyzing them, I realized how covertly
antisemitic propaganda operates — by manipulating emotions of the
readers, their sympathies are gradually shifted toward the enemies of the
Jews, toward those who seek to destroy Israel.  Moreover, it makes absolutely no
difference whether this propaganda is concocted by Soviet communists or Western
leftists — their propaganda methods are identical.  This is one example among
numerous methods of manipulating readers, collectively known as
[media bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_bias).
Currently one of the most egregious examples of bias against Israel is
[BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balen_Report) and other such
ultra-leftist media outlets.

There exist many other sources of propaganda.  The strongest impression on me
was made by the report of the commission investigating the terrorist attacks of
[9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Commission_Report).  In the
transcripts of dialogues, the organizers of the attacks spent much time
convincing the perpetrators of the necessity of carrying them out: instructions
were constantly interspersed with persuasion and the instilling of the thought
that Allah demands these attacks be committed, and that afterwards the
terrorists would enter paradise with virgins, etc.

What can be opposed to the propaganda of religious fanatics?
One of the most effective ways to combat misanthropic ideologies is enlightenment.
Only enlightenment can help diminish the influence of propaganda in spreading
antisemitic conspiracy theories and reduce the level of antisemitism —
for example, when Holocaust lessons are taught in schools at an early age,
compassion for the victims remains in memory later on.
I remember how at school, as part of anti-racist education, we had to buy
school supplies in stores and send them to needy children in Africa.
I think I would not have become a racist even without this, but warm feelings
toward black people still remain from memories of my help to those in need in Africa.
Therefore, both Holocaust lessons and aid to the needy and studying the history of
peoples who have suffered — all this helps combat xenophobia.  Hatred is born of
ignorance, and educated people are more tolerant not only toward their neighbor,
but also toward people who are very different from them — only if antisemitism is
not deliberately encouraged, as is done by far-left professors in universities.

For the same reason, civilized nations must help Israel bring
enlightenment and the prosperity accompanying it to Arab countries.
<!-- First came prosperity from oil, and then enlightenment for the sake of
recognition by the West.  But in democratic countries it is often the reverse:
enlightenment leads to prosperity.  --> For example, the monarchies of the
Arabian Peninsula, as they have developed through progress, have become
increasingly friendly toward Israel, which made possible the signing of
Abraham Accords.
<!-- From the sale of oil they have accumulated considerable wealth; they have
much to lose, and therefore for their own security it is more advantageous for
them to befriend Israel against the Iranian threat — just as Western countries
unite against common threats. -->

Therefore, the Palestinian conflict has the following solution — members of the
political left from Western countries and Muslims from enlightened Arab nations
must jointly engage directly in cultivating tolerance among the rising
generation of Palestinian Arabs.  Among other things, they must finance and
organize Holocaust lessons in Palestinian schools, in order to eradicate
hatred toward Jews among Arabs.

In fairness, this is required simply for the sake of symmetry: Israeli schools
do not call for the destruction of Arabs, therefore Palestinian schools should
not do so either.  Most Jews regard well those Arabs who do not seek to become
terrorists.  Arabs should have the same attitude toward Jews.  Not even one
hundred percent symmetry is required — there is no need to grant Hebrew exactly
the same special status that Arabic has in Israel.  Arabs are not required to
grant citizenship to as many Jews as there are Arabs who hold Israeli
citizenship and have equal rights with Jews — in Israel there are even
more Muslim citizens than Jews in Europe.  What is required is only to
eliminate today's complete asymmetry: when Israel's desire for peace
is met from the other side only with hatred.

<!-- The same asymmetry is observed in the demand to create a state exclusively
for Arabs, in which there is no place for Jews.  This is the sole reason why
left-wing antisemites so fiercely oppose settlement construction — so that the
new state would be *Judenfrei* from the outset.  If left-wing fanatics
admitted even a modicum of justice, then according to the “two-state” theory,
just as the Jewish state has a large percentage of Arab population, so too in
the Arab state there should remain a Jewish minority in the settlements.
Therefore, a powerful argument against antisemites protesting settlement
construction is that the settlements must continue to be developed, because Jews
must remain in these settlements even in the case of two states.  Thus, the
first step toward peace is acceptance of a Jewish minority in the settlements.
Otherwise, all these participants in protests against Israel are simply Nazis. -->

But the current generation is hopelessly lost, because from childhood
they were raised to hate Jews, and because of this they grew up as murderers
who must be kept in cages as animals — and simply liquidated when they
as zombies, zombified by antisemitic propaganda, as in the film
*[World War Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_Z_(film))*, storm
the walls and with inhuman cruelty kill everyone: infants, women, the elderly.
If according to the “two-state” theory for two peoples, a new state were
created now, the result would be yet another Iran right on the border
of Israel.  Only antisemites could demand such a thing.  It is absurd that
instead of bringing enlightenment to inhumane regimes in countries such as Iran,
the Western left, on the contrary, demands an increase in the number of such
countries.  Gaza was long ago granted autonomy, but instead of building
a civilized society there, Western leftists hypocritically encouraged
the rule of ruthless murderers.

<!-- Otherwise, if no one is willing to take responsibility for fostering
tolerance among Palestinian Arabs instead of sponsoring terrorism, then another
solution is for Islamic countries, on their vast expanses that are 1000 times
larger than the area of Israel, to allocate territory equal in size to the West
Bank and Gaza Strip — like the majority of Palestinian Arabs have long since
found refuge in neighboring countries.  Such a population exchange would be
just: Jews from Muslim countries, forced to leave their places of residence,
would be compensated and replaced with Palestinian Arabs in their stead.

And likewise for the countries of Europe — as many Jews as were destroyed and
expelled from there, so many Palestinian Arabs should be accepted as migrants.
Moreover, they themselves would voluntarily agree to such an exchange,
especially with additional compensation, if the authorities of these countries
would permit it — just as millions of migrants from Arab countries have long
since moved to Europe.  Therefore nothing new is being proposed — for a long
time now, instead of arranging normal life in Muslim countries, Western
countries have preferred to accept millions of Arab migrants.  But instead of
accepting migrants from troubled countries, they must help improve living
conditions in those countries.  And migrants should be accepted exclusively
from Palestine only.  As a result, two problems will be resolved at once:
the standard of living in troubled countries will rise, and peace will be
established not only in Israel and the Middle East, but throughout
the entire world. -->

Thus the responsibility for resolving the Palestinian problem falls entirely
upon everyone who is outraged by any action Israel takes in self-defense.
The responsibility passes to the majority of UN member states that have grown
accustomed to always voting against Israel.  Therefore their foremost task is
not the “establishment of a Palestinian state” but education, i.e.,
upbringing and teaching of Arabs in the fundamentals of the civilized world.
This will significantly diminish the degree of antisemitism, thereby bringing
closer a global peace among nations.

Those who do not consider themselves antisemites and yet support the “two-state
solution” must teach the Palestinian Arabs tolerance, just as the neighboring
Arab states have already learned tolerance toward the Jewish state.  Otherwise,
the world is obliged to acknowledge that the “two-state” option is unworkable.

<!-- Either they genuinely want to solve this problem,
and then they begin to work on cultivating tolerance among Arabs.
Or they take responsibility for the second solution.
Both of these options will save human lives — instead of endless suffering and wars. -->

<!-- Peace will come when the Arabs renounce the expansionist destruction of
other peoples, renounce the goal of replacing indigenous populations, as they
have done in Egypt and other countries, and as they plan to do in Palestine,
appropriating for themselves the Jewish name. -->

In general, antisemitism is a form of racism and xenophobia that can exist even
in countries where there are no Jews.  Antisemitism is simply the most striking
indicator of the level of tolerance in a society and respect for other people.
When there are no Jews nearby, the hatred shifts to members of another group
of the population that stands out from the general mass such as successful
and rich business owners, etc.

From an early age, I frequently encountered manifestations of antisemitism.
I remember how my favorite mathematics teacher, Faina Isaakovna, during school
vacation traveled by car to visit her relatives in Belarus, got into an accident
on the road, and perished together with her daughter.  And after this terrible
incident, other teachers opened her desk and at the bottom of a drawer found
a note from some pupil with antisemitic curses addressed to the teacher and
wishes of death.  I do not claim there is a direct connection between these
events, but for me it was a strong shock.

Even though my Jewish origins were carefully concealed, and even my Jewish
surname resembled a Russian one, it was impossible to hide my Jewishness
completely — nothing saved me from antisemitic incidents.

In my childhood I had such a speech impediment that prevented the proper
pronunciation of R like it was customary to portray a stereotypical Jew in
jokes.  Therefore when I spoke, my Jewishness would noticeably protrude.
This continued until age 8, and then a speech therapist came to school with
speech assessments, discovered this defect and said that circumcision is
required.  They referred me for tongue-tie surgery, performed without anesthesia,
it was not painful.  And immediately after the circumcision of tongue
frenulum ([frenectomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenectomy))
I was able to pronounce R the same way as everyone else.
<!-- Therefore even my tongue is Jewish — circumcised.  -->

But in behavior and worldview I was a typical Jewish child — there was nothing
non-Jewish about me, my Jewish origin was immediately apparent, so I became
a victim of antisemitism regardless.  Thus, due to antisemitic attacks against
me in childhood, I realized that I was a Jew, and that my fate was Jewish.

<!-- In infancy my mother refused to nurse me with her milk, so I had
a disrupted metabolism (at least, that is how the doctors explained it).
And in Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Ishut
[21:13](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Marriage.21.13)
it is said that a mother must nurse her child until two years of age. -->
From infancy, due to an allergy to sugar, I was forbidden to eat sweets.
Sometimes I couldn't bear being without sweets, especially when everyone
around me was enjoying delicious chocolate candies, and then I would eat
a little something sweet.  But even from a small candy an immediate severe
allergic reaction would begin, and inflammation and boils would break out
from head to foot —
<!-- not tzara'at, not white as snow (Bemidbar [12:10](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.12.10)) -->
exactly like sore boils on Iyyov, who was subjected to the trials of Satan
(Iyyov [2:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Job.2.7)).
<!-- the same as in Devarim [28:35](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.28.35) -->

But the most terrible thing was when, during shop class at school, dirt would
get into the open wounds on my hands — the dirt would eat away at the wounds,
and this caused unbearable, hellish pain.  Therefore, during shop class this
physical affliction prevented me from working normally.  And the shop teacher
ignored my problems and simply stupidly gave me low grades, and thereby spoiled
my certificate, where otherwise everything was excellent.

And so my defense was taken up by the teacher who taught me in first grade.
After the start of school this Russian teacher placed first at the head of the
class a Jewish girl, and next to her me as a Jewish boy.  And as she determined
the order, so it remained throughout the entire time of study — when the girl
was promoted, I would take her place at the head of the class, and so on.
And just as my first teacher regarded me as the best student, so I remained
an excellent student with all the other teachers.

So my first teacher came to the shop teacher and began asking him not to ruin my
certificate because of my health problems.  And then this shop teacher pulled
out the class register (at the end of the register were recorded the pupils' and
their parents' personal data), spitefully jabbed at my entry and shrilly shrieked:
“Look here, his father's patronymic is Davidovich.  David is a Jewish name,
which means this pupil is a Jew!  And all Jews are lazy and don't like to work,
and this Jew is the same layabout as all Jews, doesn't like to work!”

This was a blatant antisemitic slander — my Jewish grandfather David Judkovich
loved to work very much.  Even in retirement, every day from early morning until
late evening he spent his time at the workbench, always making things and
constructing a lot.  And I inherited from my grandfather a love of labor —
I never sat idle; in childhood I was always constructing something.
<!-- For example, built models from miniature to gigantic, etc. -->

This was the same kind of slander as the claims of antisemites that during the
Second World War in the Soviet Union Jews did not fight as everyone, but stayed
behind the lines, lying low in Tashkent.  But in reality, among the half-million
Jews who fought, grandfather heroically battled at the front against the
German-Fascist invaders: he commanded military transport units (since before
the war he had graduated from the Kharkiv Automobile and Highway Institute
[KhADI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_National_Automobile_and_Highway_University)
where his diploma project was on the topic: “Underground Mechanized Service
Station for 350 Taxicabs in Kyiv” with an excellent grade), he directed
the construction of crossings, forced water barriers under enemy fire, ensured
the supply of residents of besieged Leningrad across the ice of the lake on the
[Road of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_of_Life),
rose to the rank of engineer-colonel, and was awarded several medals.
<!-- Being a veteran, on holidays grandfather would put on his dress naval
tunic (kittel) with rows of medals, and let me play with his personal dirk. -->

By civilian profession my grandfather was a construction engineer.
For example, he oversaw the delivery of materials for the construction of the
television tower — the challenge being that for eight months it was necessary
to ensure an uninterrupted concrete pour throughout the entire height of three
hundred meters.  I remember visiting him during his night shifts at the Ministry
of Construction and seeing how the telephone rang constantly, and he
continuously issued instructions over the phone.

My grandfather saw in me the continuation of his lineage, and as I recall,
a special bond formed between us after one amusing incident.  One day we were
walking in the park.  I was a little over five years old, already able to read
and write, and I began tracing with a stick on the ground the letters of my
surname: L I N K O V.  When I finished, grandfather asked what I had written.
I replied that it was my surname.  But grandfather inquired whether perhaps
I had written his surname.  And then I exclaimed in amazement:
“What?!  You're Linkov TO-O-OO?!”
<!-- It would be no less amusing if I had exclaimed: “You're Jewish too?!” -->
My grandfather laughed joyfully at my naivety,
and then often recalled this amusing incident with laughter.
<!-- At that age I already knew that this surname was mine and my father's,
but I did not yet know about my grandfather. -->

![Linkov David](../../../files/book/linkov_david.jpg){:.center}

Though the surname resembles a Russian one,
our surname is Jewish,
and derives from the name of a Jewish shtetl
[Linkuva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkuva) in Lithuania
not far from the [Ponevezh Yeshiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponevezh_Yeshiva).
<!-- Information from the book
*[A Dictionary of Jewish Surnames from the Russian Empire](https://www.avotaynu.com/books/DJSRE2.htm)*. -->

It was very offensive when the Orthodoxes mocked my Jewish surname.  As soon
as they learned my surname, the Orthodox rabbis began reproaching me for this
surname they considered non-Jewish, saying how I should be ashamed to intrude
among Jews with such a gentile surname — as Ashkenazim with German surnames told me.
<!-- And it's even worse with Russian surnames inherited from non-Jewish fathers. -->
When the Orthodoxes trampled on my Jewish surname and shamed me for
my Jewish surname, it was an insult to all my Jewish ancestors.

I wonder if those Orthodox rabbis with German surnames would not be ashamed
to approach my Litvak ancestors with a Litvish surname and present to them
directly all these accusations about an insufficiently Jewish surname?

My great-great-grandfather Shimshon (Samson) Linkov ז״ל was a religious Jew.
He was shot by Russian antisemitic Armed Forces of South Russia during a
[pogrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogroms_during_the_Russian_Civil_War)
in Cherkasy on August 6/(19), 1919.

Could the Orthodoxes with German surnames have approached my
great-great-grandfather praying in the synagogue and reproached him for his
“insufficiently Jewish”, “Russian” surname?  Not only do the Orthodoxes mock
the memory of my Jewish ancestors, but like antisemites they also demand that
they be completely forgotten.  When a Jew through the paternal line takes pride
in his Jewish ancestors — it triggers the same outraged reaction from both
antisemites and Orthodoxes.

<!-- At the time I did not yet resent the Orthodoxes for this, but I recalled
it only after the Orthodoxes rejected me.  In general, I suffered both from
antisemites and from the Orthodoxes. -->

Even worse is what the Orthodoxes do when in their prayers they demand
the destruction of all non-Orthodox Jews.  In one of the blessings of the
*Shmoneh Esrei* prayer, in *Birkat ha‑minim*, they demand that “all apostates
perish in an instant”.  <!-- It is strange that the possibility of their teshuvah
is excluded. -->  Here “apostates” *minim* refers to all Jews who do not submit
to Orthodox rabbis.  Formerly these were the Karaites and other opponents of
the Rabbanites — in the *[Kuzari](https://www.sefaria.org/Kuzari.3.65)*
it is clearly stated that the Sadducees and Boethusians are considered
apostates *minim* who are cursed in the prayers.
{: #brachot-klalot title="Blessings and Curses"}

And now the Orthodoxes count as *minim* the Reformists, the Traditionalists
*masortim*, and all the more so secular Jews.  And the Kitzur Shulchan Arukh
even instructs everyone to rejoice at the death of Jews who do not observe
in full all the ordinances of the rabbis.

Though it is called a blessing, it is in fact a curse.  And thus three times
a day, six days a week, the Orthodoxes curse not only antisemites but also
Zionists.  Just as antisemites wish to wipe Jews off the face of the Earth, so
too the Orthodoxes wish to wipe non-Orthodox Jews off the face of the Earth.

I remember in the 1990s, a thought experiment was discussed online for
identifying antisemites: if there existed a button, pressing which would destroy
all members of a particular nationality, the question was asked: would you be
able to press such a button?  And depending on the answer, a definition was given:
in case of a positive answer, the respondent was identified as an antisemite
if it concerned Jews, etc.

Since three times a day in prayer the Orthodoxes recite an antisemitic petition
for the destruction of Jews: “may all apostates perish in an instant”, where the
word “apostates” refers to Jews who do not observe all Orthodox stringencies
(*[chumrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chumra_(Judaism))*) — not only
Reformists, but all non-Orthodoxes in general, all Jews who do not follow
all the precepts of the Shulchan Arukh, and certainly all patrilineal Jews,
about whom the Orthodoxes are constantly preoccupied with how to rid themselves
of them as quickly as possible, as if they had never existed, according to the
principle of idolaters: “no person — no problem”.  Does it follow that if the
Orthodoxes had a button that would destroy Jews who do not fully observe all
the ordinances of the Orthodoxes, they would press it, so that all apostates
would “perish in an instant”, as they constantly pray for?

The following question necessarily follows from this: if the Orthodoxes prayed
with curses for the destruction of “apostate” Jews before the Holocaust,
could this have influenced the destruction of Jews during the Holocaust?
After all, regarding the majority of Jews in territories that fell under Nazi
rule, it could be said that they were apostates, i.e., those who had left
the Orthodox ghetto and abandoned the observance of all stringencies.

Curses do not operate directly.  When G‑d is displeased with the behavior of
people, He does not punish them immediately <!-- as it is said in Yechezkel
[22:4](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.22.4) “therefore have I given you” --> —
the punishment is carried out by the satan.  And curses point out to the satan
whom to focus upon, and further spur the satan on, compelling the satan to more
actively subject them to trials and to influence the minds of their enemies for
their punishment.  And then for a time G‑d may weaken the protection from the
consequences of the satan's influence upon the enemies, who completely submit
their will to the satan's sway.  On the other hand, blessings are petitions
to G‑d to strengthen His protection.

Adam and Chavah were subjected to their first trial by the satan-serpent.
When they failed to withstand this trial, as a result of the curse their level
of protection was lowered, whereby they and their descendants became subject
to a greater number of trials from the satan.

When the Torah states that the iniquity of the fathers is visited upon the
children and grandchildren to the third and fourth generation, this curse does
not mean that protection is completely removed from the children, because it is
said that children are not punished for the sins of their fathers
(Devarim [24:16](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.24.16),
Yirmeyahu [31:29](https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.31.29),
Yechezkel [18:20](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.18.20)).  Rather, it means
that the intensity of Satan's trials increases for these generations of
descendants, to determine which among them continue to hate G‑d.
<!-- and are punished for this alone -->  And when it is said that mercy is
preserved for thousands of generations, this blessing means that for the
descendants the level of protection from Satan's attacks is raised.  But only
for those who continue to love G‑d.  Therefore they will not remain unpunished
if their sins increase.

In the Torah, examples were shown of how blessings and curses operate.
<!-- *brakhot* and *klalot* -->  Balak and Bilam had antisemitic inclinations,
but Bilam refused to curse the Jewish people out of fear of punishment, since
an undeserved curse returns to the one who curses, as is known from the Torah:

> And I will bless those who bless you, and those who curse you I will curse,
and through you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.
(Beresheet [12:3](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.12.3),
[27:29](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.27.29))

> How shall I curse whom G‑d has not cursed?
How shall I invoke wrath upon whom G‑d is not wroth?
(Bemidbar [23:8](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.23.8))

<!-- And Makkot [11a](https://www.sefaria.org/Makkot.11a.14) draws attention to
Mishlei [26:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.26.2): “an undeserved curse will
not come to pass” where “undeserved” is in the sense that the Satan has difficulty
gaining a foothold. -->

Bilam knew that if G‑d is not wrathful toward the people, He continues to protect
the people from the attacks of the satan, and then the satan cannot cause harm.
When the satan realizes the futility of his attempts, out of desperation he
redirects his fury back upon the one who incited the satan with his curses.
And then that person receives from the satan in full measure all that the satan
typically does: subjects him to trials, based on the results of the trials shows
his deficiencies to G‑d with a request to diminish the protection, and uses
enemies for punishment.

As Balak and Bilam sought to curse the Jews, so too do the Orthodoxes demand to
curse non-Orthodox Jews.  But since curses may return upon the curser, it's
important to pronounce blessings instead of curses.

Therefore, following this example from the Torah, I bless the traditionalists,
I bless the reformists, I bless the progressive Jews, I bless the liberal Jews,
I bless all non-Orthodoxes in general, and the Orthodoxes as well, despite everything.

During my tribulations and prolonged wanderings through numerous synagogues,
I had occasion to pray from various siddurim with different nusachim and
different translations.  I must note that the compilers of certain siddurim
recognized the gravity of the consequences of this destructive curse and left
only the curse against antisemites, while removing the curse against apostates.
Here I will not enumerate which siddurim of which nusachim retained the curse
against “wrong” Jews and which removed it — this is publicly available
information.

The only thing that saves non-Orthodox Jews from destruction is the fact that
the Orthodoxes pray without kavanah, so their requests in prayer to destroy
non-Orthodox Jews have no effect.  It is even for the best that the Orthodoxes
pray without kavanah, otherwise non-Orthodox Jews could suffer heavily as
a result of their prayers.
{: #kavanah title="Kavanah"}

Indeed, the Orthodoxes do not immerse themselves sufficiently in prayer, and
therefore their prayers have no effect.  For example, when someone occasionally
walks past Orthodoxes at prayer, they become distracted from their prayers and
express displeasure at having been interrupted, reacting to the movements of people
around them.  This happens when they are not concentrated on prayer, when they
pray without kavanah.  If they prayed with kavanah, they would notice nothing
of what happens around them during prayer.

In my life there have been instances when I was so engrossed in an activity that
I paid no attention to external distractions.  The following example may seem
insignificant, but I can no longer recall any other occupation that so strongly
captivated me and completely seized all my attention.  It was a computer game
called *[Civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(video_game))*.
Playing *Civilization* is like a chess match unfolding on a board with an enormous
number of squares, across which chess pieces move, representing different groups
of people.
Due to stress I was highly sensitive to even the slightest distracting sounds,
but for the entire day <!-- all 12 hours --> that a gaming session of
*Civilization* lasted, the game so completely absorbed my attention that not
only could I not tear myself away from the computer screen, not only could
I not be distracted even for a second, but I also absolutely did not notice any
disturbances.  Once, while playing, my neighbors were moving, and it was very
noisy: all day long they were dragging furniture around, loudly bumping against
my front door, etc.  Usually such noises would have bothered me greatly.
But when I was fully absorbed in the process, I noticed none of it at all.
And only after finishing the game, retrieving subconscious memories,
did I realize how loud the noise had been.

For me this became the standard of immersion in an activity — by this standard
it's possible to measure the level of immersion in prayer and strive for such
complete immersion that nothing could distract from prayer and Torah study, not
a single source of [loud sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness):
neither loud conversation, nor noisy neighbors, nor even the roar of a jet
engine turbine (or the equivalent in decibels of a rock concert's thunder), etc.

<!-- To test the quality of one's prayer, one can, for example, turn on the
radio at full volume during prayer and try to understand how well the
meaning of the prayer remains comprehensible. -->

Therefore, just as G‑d is focused on the development of human civilization,
we on our part must achieve the same level of focus during prayer in order
to establish a continuous connection with G‑d.

<!-- If we continue the comparison with computer games, *Civilization* is
a prime example of a highly intellectual game, while at the other end of the
spectrum are mindless shooters like *DOOM* and similar ones.  In precisely
the same way, highly intellectual prayers and slaughterhouse sacrifices
are diametrically opposed. -->

Instead of trying to compensate for the absence of kavanah with a larger
quantity of prayers, it is better to pray less, but with higher quality —
with kavanah, with complete concentration of attention on the prayer,
i.e., it's necessary to focus in such a way that nothing can distract.
And when we pray with kavanah, then prayer helps.

Also the Ashkenazic pronunciation does not add persuasiveness to the prayer.
<!-- When angels, trained in understanding prayers in Hebrew,
hear distorted phonetics, they cannot comprehend anything,
and therefore do not transmit further the report of the recited prayers,
as stated in Shabbat [12b](https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.12b.2).
Thus Ashkenazic pronunciation distances them even further from G‑d. -->
Moreover, adherents of the Ashkenazic pronunciation demonstratively separate
themselves from all Jews: during prayers in any minyan there is always such
a preacher of Ashkenazic pronunciation who, after everyone together in chorus
says “Amen!”, he loudly after everyone else, so that all may hear, cries out
“O-O-Omey-y-yn!”, as if insisting on his exclusively correct pronunciation and
thereby reproaching others for not following him.  This destroys the unity of
the Jewish people.  Precisely the same pattern of behavior is demonstrated by
Orthodoxes toward non-Orthodox Jews.

{: .chapter}

As a counterexample to the observance of this commandment in recent history,
the communist idolaters enacted a law directly opposite to the Torah — the
[Law of Three Spikelets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Spikelets) —
whereby watchtowers with armed guards were erected at the edges of fields,
so that not a single ear of grain, not a single kernel would reach the starving.
And the punishment for each spikelet picked up from the edge of a field was
the most severe, including the death penalty.

The main meaning of this commandment is not to strive to cover everything 100
percent as the Nazis did when they attempted to destroy all Jews without
exception, and then declared a territory 100 percent
[Judenfrei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judenfrei).

As the Nazis attempted to identify Jews with one hundred percent coverage,
so now the Orthodoxes have stooped so low as to carry out inspections
by DNA testing with German thoroughness and meticulousness — the same kind
of infiltration is being carried out, diminishing the number of Jews,
and once again defenseless Jews are suffering from this.

Each time an investigation into Jewishness began, scenes from numerous films
would come to mind — how the Nazis searched for Jews.  Certainly, the difference
in purpose between the verifications is immense: in one case, the checks were
conducted with the intent to kill, while in the other — merely to expel.
But even in this case, it's impossible to say that a person continues to live,
because his life has been broken — he remains not to live, but merely to exist.

Perhaps the Orthodoxes take their example from the Talmud, which also attempted
to cover absolutely all possible cases 100 percent with laws.  But in the
same Talmud in the tractate Peah, a limit to filtration is defined, and
<!-- unlike the Karaites --> it's required to leave no less than 1/60
of the entire volume, which amounts to approximately 2 percent.

<!-- I noticed that approximately 20 percent of the remaining work (e.g.,
morphological analysis of natural language words) requires 80 percent of the
time and effort due to the need to consider increasingly complex non-standard
cases and exceptions to the rules, 10% — 90%, 5% — 95%.  This pattern is known
as the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle). -->

Therefore, following this rule, it would be possible to spare 2 percent
from humiliating inspections by limiting them to the
[98th percentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/98th_percentile).
This is an absolute maximum, but for greater mercy toward the needy
it would be reasonable to move the indicator needle left or right
on the chesed–gevurah scale from 0 to 100.  But not too far left —
so that concern for the gleaner would not cause great harm to the field's owner.
Or on a national scale — so that excessive aid to the socially vulnerable would
not become an unbearable burden on working citizens.
<!-- This is a vivid example of the numbers that must be dealt with in Kabbalah. -->

<!-- And in general, everywhere exceptions must be left, not covered 100%:
there should not be 100% digital currency, 100% electronic voting, especially
with the help of computers and AI (biometric data, facial recognition,
scanning of correspondence, …) -->

The sole reason the Orthodoxes now manifest an extreme degree of gevurah,
failing to help strangers as the Torah and even Halakhah insistently demand,
but instead oppress them with nitpicking and humiliations — all this is because
the Orthodoxes are attempting to preserve racial purity, so that as little
“genetic refuse” as possible seeps through the impenetrable filters of
[artificial selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_breeding)
and other forms of [eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics).

Just as the Nazis strove to guard the German nation from the penetration of
Jewish genes, so now the Orthodoxes guard the Jewish gene pool from the entry of
non-Jewish genes.  Just as the Nazis fought for the purity of Aryan blood,
including by suppressing half-bloods, whom they called
[Mischlinge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischling), so in the present time
the Orthodoxes are preoccupied with suppressing racially inferior “Mischlinge”
as undesirable elements of society: by forbidding marriage (*psulei hitun*)
to limit the birthrate of patrilineal Jews, i.e., by means resembling
sterilization, such as refusing to perform the necessary circumcision,
and thereby denying the possibility of continuing the lineage, leaving them
childless and thus taking away the right to existence.

<!-- This is not only a prohibition against Jews fulfilling the commandment
“be fruitful and multiply”, but also “it is not good for man to be alone”
(Beresheet [2:18](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.18)).  This can even be
called genocide in the sense of “deliberately creating for any group such living
conditions as are intended for its complete or partial physical destruction”. -->

Jewish genes formed in me a 100% Jewish brain, but not the shape of the skull.
But for the Orthodoxes the form of the skull is more important than its
content/contents.

Everything pertaining to the body, the Orthodoxes strictly observe, while
they do not develop the soul.  For them, it does not matter that a person
has a Jewish soul — the determining factor is only the body, built according
to certain genes.  Thus, instead of fulfilling the task set by the Torah of
spreading the Divine light, the Orthodoxes have degenerated into a struggle
for racial purity.

But I do not blame the Orthodoxes.  The desire to preserve Talmudic Judaism in
precisely the same state as it existed many centuries ago is understandable:
both genetically and at the level of all accumulated traditions, to maintain
a kind of a “[nature reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_reserve)”,
where a special protection regime is established,
in order to safeguard and preserve endangered species listed in the
[Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List), as a heritage of
humanity.  And all this has long existed in the form of closed
ultra-Orthodox communities, where genetic homogeneity is maintained.
<!-- But this is a reserve of the Middle Ages, not of original, pristine Judaism. -->
The ultra-Orthodox drove themselves into these reservations, and even
after the end of galut they retained the habit of dwelling in a ghetto.

Therefore, it is from these premises that we must seek a solution to the
problem.  Since on the one hand the purity of blood is so important to the
Orthodoxes, and on the other hand they should not bring suffering upon the
descendants of those Jews who chose to dilute Jewish genes with the genes of
other nations, then the only solution to the problem is to follow the example of
the Torah and formalize the existing division into communities.  In the Torah
all these problems were long ago resolved in the form of dividing the people
into tribes.  And modern communities correspond to the tribes.  Therefore, just
as according to the Torah there existed a restriction on intertribal marriages:
{: #tribes title="Tribes"}

> Here is what G‑d has commanded concerning the daughters of Tzelofchad: they
may marry whomever they please, but only within a family of their father's tribe
(Bemidbar [36:6](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.36.6))

In exactly the same way, restrictions on marriages between communities within
one nation will now help preserve genetic purity in those Haredi communities
for whom this is important — just as genetic purity used to concern mainly the
Kohanim.  If they wish, they can maintain genealogical records of lineages
(*sifrei yuchasin*) — the same way as genealogies were formerly kept through
the father for priests (Josephus Flavius, *Against Apion*
[1:7](https://www.sefaria.org/Against_Apion.1.7.1)).  And when preserving
their gene pool will be guaranteed with 100% security, they will then regard
members of other communities more kindly, who will no longer pose a threat to them.

<!-- In earlier times, Jews through the mother were considered mamzerim in order
to restrict marriages with them and thereby preserve racial purity.  Later this
restriction was lifted, and now many Orthodox communities permit violations of
blood purity.  Therefore, to preserve a genetically pure race, the
ultra-Orthodox could exclude from their ranks also Jews only through the
maternal line.  And indeed, such discrimination against Jews through the mother
has long been taking place. -->

And for those communities that already include descendants of intermarriages,
racial purity is no longer important; therefore, it makes sense for them to unite
Jews who do not possess 100% Jewish genes within non-Orthodox communities.

The aforementioned law of the Torah was abolished in the era of Shoftim, but
at present the restoration of this law of the Torah would help alleviate the
suffering of those Jews who are unable to change their “flawed” genetic
inheritance: both Jews from mixed families and mamzerim.

I'm not inventing anything new — the prophets spoke of this two and a half
thousand years ago.  Yechezkel ([47:22](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.47.22))
proposes to divide Israel with the strangers who have borne children among the
children of Israel, and as native-born inhabitants they shall divide the
inheritance with all the tribes of Israel.

> And it shall be: within the tribe where the stranger resides,
there shall you give him his inheritance, — declares the L‑rd G‑d
(Yechezkel [47:23](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.47.23))

And Jews through the paternal line are not even strangers, but genuine Jews.
Yet the Orthodoxes do everything they can to keep them out of the community
of Israel.  When the Orthodoxes will recognize patrilineal Jews, then
the baseless hatred among Jews will cease.

In a general sense, modern Israel constitutes one large community.
Nevertheless, there exists a division into smaller communities within Israel,
each with its own traditions.  This division manifests most clearly among Haredi
communities — marriages between members of these communities are almost
entirely excluded, and even with baalei teshuvah, who are considered
second-class people, and all the more so with newly converted Jews,
who are considered third-class people.
<!-- The secular are also considered of lower class, and this manifests
itself, for example, in the prohibition against wine that a secular person
has touched. -->

There also exists a matrimonial division among immigrants from different
countries.  For example, according to various surveys, the overwhelming majority
of respondents are willing to marry only within their own community.
<!-- Moroccans — with Moroccans, Ethiopians — with Ethiopians, etc. -->

There is nothing wrong with this — the most important thing is that despite
differences, mutual respect must be maintained between communities, guaranteeing
unity.  But not unity as uniformity of identical views and opinions, but unity
as [togetherness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_community).
Whereas the tribes/camps/communities must be equal — there must
be no division into second-class Jews, third-class Jews, and so forth.

Then if a Jewish man or woman from a non-Orthodox tribe wishes to marry a member
of an ultra-Orthodox tribe, they must undergo a process of conversion to
ultra-Orthodox Judaism <!-- sect --> and afterward join their community.
Just as Yechezkel in [44:22](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.44.22) counseled
preserving the purity of the blood of the kohanim, so too now the purity of
blood can be maintained within ultra-Orthodox communities.

In the Temple each tribe has its own gate: there were 13 gates according to the
Mishnah Middot [2:6](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Middot.2.6), and there will
be 12 gates as foretold in Yechezkel [48:31-34](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.48.31-34),
that is, everyone has its own path of development within one people.
Just as each tribe had its own purpose, so too all contemporary communities
are significant, enriching Judaism through their diversity.

It is important that friendship and respect be maintained among the tribes.
The unity of the people does not consist in everyone being alike as clones,
nor in everyone behaving identically as programmed robots, but the unity of
the people must consist in mutual respect for one another, despite differences.
<!-- There should be no such enmity as when Litvaks scorn Hasidim, and all
together they hate the Reformists, etc. -->  And this will serve as a good
example for the entire world.

The TaNaKh teaches to what the enmity between the tribes leads, when after the
division into the Northern Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah both were
defeated, unable individually to withstand external threats.  Therefore in
Yechezkel [37:22](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.37.22) a prohibition was given:
“And they shall never again be divided into two kingdoms” —
as a loving mother refused to divide her child at the court of Shlomo.
Consequently, ideas of dividing into two states are unacceptable,
as, for example, the Kahanists proposed to create a separate
[State of Judea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Judea).

A possible symbiosis could be such that while Orthodox communities constantly
pray, observe all the details of stringencies and continuously study the Talmud,
at the same time non-Orthodox Jews, without departing from the observance of
Torah commandments, spend their time and energy performing work to improve
the world and pay taxes.

For example, according to tradition there existed a division of duties between
the neighboring tribes of Issachar and Zebulun: the tribe of Issachar sat in
tents and occupied itself with the study of Torah, while the tribe of Zebulun
worked and provided for the sustenance and material support of the tribe of
Issachar.  In modern times such a division of duties appears as follows:
like the tribe of Issachar, the Orthodoxes preserve the traditions, and like
the tribe of Zebulun, non-Orthodox Jews work diligently for the betterment
of the world.

When all parties consent, a <!-- tenth --> portion of taxes may go toward supporting
the Haredi communities.  According to Rambam, this is one of the 613 commandments
([M﬩6](https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot,_Positive_Commandments.6)).
In Sifrei Devarim [49:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Devarim.49.2), the
Torah's words “cling to Him” are equivalent to the words “cling to the sages”
as G‑d's representatives on earth; therefore, everyone is required to provide
for the sustenance of yeshiva students.

But on the other hand, it should be noted that the tribe of Naphtali,
which combined Torah study with labor, achieved significantly greater
success in Torah study than the tribe of Issachar (Divrei ha‑yamim I
[12:32,34](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.12.33-35); Shir HaShirim
Rabbah [8:11](https://www.sefaria.org/Shir_HaShirim_Rabbah.8.11)).
And subsequently, in the time of the compilation of the Talmud,
the rabbis established such a consensus in Berakhot
[35b](https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.35b.8), that one can achieve
success in Torah study only by combining Torah study with labor.

Therefore, a more suitable model of conduct for ultra-Orthodox communities
could be the tribe of Levi:
{: #levites title="Levites"}

> And to the sons of Levi I have given every tithe in Israel for their work,
which they perform in the service of the Tent of Meeting
(Bemidbar [18:21](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.18.21))

<!-- Later in Devarim [14:23](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.14.23)
it is said to eat the tithe in the Temple oneself — such difference is caused
by the increase in the people's numbers in a later historical period: i.e.,
when there were few people, the Levites could eat the tithe, but when the
people became more numerous, the Levites could no longer eat it all. -->

As is evident from the Torah, the Levites did not sit idle, occupied only with
the study of Torah, but constantly applied the knowledge they had acquired in
practice, not distancing themselves from the people, but working for the benefit
of the entire community and receiving appropriate compensation for it.
Moreover, besides their work, they simply had nothing else to occupy themselves
with, since they did not need to read much — the many thick volumes of the
Talmud had not yet been written, and they were too conscientious to idle away
their time.

Bemidbar [8:24-25](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.8.24-25) establishes that
Levites must serve from the age of 25 (though in the census they were counted
from age 30 in Bemidbar [4:3](https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.4.3)) and retire
at 50, thereafter continuing to guard the Temple instead of serving.
Therefore those ultra-Orthodox who refuse to serve in the army,
just as the fainthearted are exempted from military service
(Devarim [20:8](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.20.8)), could perform
alternative civilian service *sherut leumi*, which in principle corresponds
to the service of the Levites.
<!-- Despite the fact that Rambam in Laws of Shemittah and Yovel
[13:12](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Sabbatical_Year_and_the_Jubilee.13.12),
with reference to Devarim [33:10](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.33.10),
equates all who study Torah with Levites and exempts them from service, which
contradicts the TaNaKh, where the Levites both taught Torah to the people and
themselves served. -->

What did the Levites do?  What work did they perform?
Divrei ha‑yamim I [23:3-5](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.23.3-5) reports
that in the time of King David a total of 38,000 Levites were counted: of these,
24,000 worked in the Temple, 6,000 were judges and overseers, 4,000 served as
Temple guards, and another 4,000 sang in the Temple, accompanying on musical
instruments.  In the era of the Second Temple they also participated in the
preparation of sacrifices.

Since in our time sacrifices have been replaced with prayers, the new function
accordingly must be to provide the people with various services: to conduct
prayers, perform rituals, and carry out other forms of worship service.
This is precisely what rabbis now do — the ancient Levites correspond to modern
rabbis, who not only study themselves but also teach others, and work
extensively providing religious services.  This also includes numerous
specialized occupations, such as mohalim, gabbaim, chazzanim, sofrim, etc.

I have had the opportunity to witness firsthand the tremendous work that rabbis
perform for their communities: disseminating their knowledge, organizing Jewish
life, and finding time not only for teaching, conducting prayers and festivals,
but also for resolving the diverse problems of the community.

Many sages of antiquity combined work with the study of Torah.  Hillel the Elder
worked by day as a woodcutter, and devoted his nights to the study of Torah
(see Rambam's commentary on Pirkei Avot
[4:5](https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.5?with=Rambam)).  Rambam himself
spent much time working as a physician, and in his remaining hours led a large
community, yet at the same time wrote numerous books of wisdom — G‑d grants
wisdom to one who works much.

On the other hand, those who only study but do not apply the knowledge gained in
practice and do not share knowledge with others are egoists, appropriating the
accumulated Divine light and obstructing its dissemination.

But why then do not all ultra-Orthodox Jews work, actively engaging in the
rectification of the world?

{: .chapter}

I write only about what concerns me personally.  If Orthodox rabbis had approved
my repatriation to Israel under the Law of Return, and I had come to live in
Israel, then I would have the right to criticize and be outraged that my money
via taxes goes to support non-working ultra-Orthodox who sit all day
in yeshivas reading books.

I don't know whether I would really be outraged, like many taxpayers.
Most likely not, because I always sympathized with the Orthodoxes and for
religious reasons sought support from Orthodox rabbis.  And when I looked upon
yeshiva students diligently working through the Talmud, such a sight filled me
with warm feelings.  But since the Orthodoxes did not let me into Israel,
these remain only speculative suppositions.

Yet I have the right to raise the problem of idleness among the ultra-Orthodox, for
it is a tragedy of our family.  I have a relative with almost the same name and age.
In childhood we were friends.  Pleasant memories remain of when he would come to
visit during summer holidays, and we would go to the sea together.
He and I were alike not only in name and age — he also became a programmer.
But then our paths diverged: I began working in my field, while he made aliyah
to Israel, joined an ultra-Orthodox community, and has not worked since.
He could resume working at any moment, since he hadn't lost his
professional skills.  For example, recently his community needed to implement
a web service, and he created it using a modern programming language,
but then he stopped working again.

Because he left the society, our relatives constantly mourn for him.
When an Orthodox leaves the community, they sit shiva and recite Kaddish for him.
Likewise, our relatives are in constant mourning for him as for one departed from life.
They had hoped that when he grew up, he would benefit society.
But instead he shut himself off from the world, wasted his talents,
and refused to work toward the betterment of the world.  It pains me
to see how much grief this has brought to our family.

<!-- The non-use of abilities given by G‑d and the refusal to work in the field
of one's calling is tantamount to suicide, and the encouragement of such
a decision is incitement to suicide. -->

In our family there have never been idlers.
My great-great-grandfather Shimshon (Samson) Linkov was fully observant,
attended synagogue, but worked his entire life in an insurance company.
<!-- He lived in Cherkasy in his house on Peschany Lane.

I too wanted to do something useful for people, but just as the ultra-Orthodox
turn away from work many capable people, so too was I deprived of the
opportunity to work at full strength due to the suffering inflicted upon me by
the Orthodoxes.  And so much good I could have done.  But when the Orthodoxes
persecuted me, from despair I had no strength to work, and I was constantly
in chronic stress.
And this not counting the lost time when I could do nothing due to health
problems, when the Orthodoxes refused to perform circumcision on me,
and balanoposthitis led to pathological damage to internal organs.
But even when I had no strength to work and I suffered from lack of money,
G‑d compelled me to work through need, thereby communicating about the sin
of parasitic existence.

<!--
On one hand, stress and constant pressure from problems help develop the soul.
For example, in totalitarian states with strict censorship, the constant
pressure from authorities forces creative people to develop new forms of
expression in order to continue conveying truth to people in veiled ways.

Thus, stress promotes development; stress is the engine of progress.
But stress must be in moderation.

Stress is the opposite of depression.  In depression, a person languishes with
nothing to do, when nothing appeals to them, whereas in stress, conversely,
a person is so intensely occupied that an excessive burden falls upon them.

I have never experienced depression, except for a couple of times the morning
after sweet wine, when, as if in a stupor, I did not even wish to move.
When stress is soothed with sweets, the sweets diminish stress but increase
depression.  There is also such a dichotomy: one who is in depression
drinks coffee to invigorate oneself, whereas one who is in stress
drinks tea to calm oneself.
-->

Why then do many ultra-Orthodox not work, and even as seen in my case
cause obstacles for others?  <!-- They themselves do not work,
and they prevent others from doing so. -->
What do the sages say about this?

Rabbi Yishmael in JT Peah
[1:1](https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.1.1.21) teaches that
the words of Devarim [30:19](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.30.19)
“Choose life” refer to the requirement to work, since work is necessary
for sustaining life.

Rabbi Yehudah in Kiddushin [29a](https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.29a.10) says
that anyone who does not teach his son a trade teaches him robbery.
For without a profession he will be forced to resort to obtaining
his livelihood through criminal means.

Rabban Gamliel, son of Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi, in Pirkei Avot
[2:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.2) instructs that it is good
to combine the study of Torah with some craft, because this distances one
from sin.  By sin here is meant the necessity of seeking unlawful or
corrupt ways of obtaining a livelihood.

And the Ohr HaChaim commentary on Shemot
[35:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.35.2?with=Or%20HaChaim) states explicitly
that work during the six days is a mitzvah, a positive commandment.

Why then, according to statistical data, do half of the ultra-Orthodox violate
this commandment and not work, but instead spend all their time reading books?

The problem is that the list of literature recommended for reading among
Orthodoxes is too extensive.  In addition to the TaNaKh, which reading
was confined to more than 2000 years ago, present-day Orthodoxes need to know
thoroughly the contents of all the numerous volumes of the Talmud with
commentaries, with commentaries on those commentaries (called *supercommentaries*),
with commentaries on commentaries on commentaries, and so on to unlimited depth.
<!-- This is often called *supercommentaries*, though the more correct synonym
would be *subcommentaries*. -->  They must also read many books written
by rabbis of the past, even though many topics that concerned people
at that time have long since lost their relevance.  Therefore,
the [perpetual students](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_student)
of yeshivot have no time left for work.

The great sage Shlomo taught: “Beware of making many books, my son —
there is no end to them, and much reading is weariness of the flesh”
(Kohelet [12:12](https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.12.12)).

Thus Shlomo was the first to warn of the emergence of such a modern problem as
[information overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload),
when there is insufficient time to absorb the increasing flows of information.

On the one hand, when the rabbis express all possible opinions, this increases
the likelihood that one of the opposing views is true.  And indeed, if we
imagine theoretically that an infinite number of sages over an infinitely
long period of time were recording all possible opinions, then sooner or later,
amidst the infinite stream of opinions, true statements might also be emerge.

But on the other hand, since none of them can understand which of all the
opinions is the true one, the Orthodoxes are required to study and fulfill
all these opinions.

The most lamentable thing is that such egotism of graphomaniacs leads them to
violate the commandment “Thou shalt not steal”, when for the satisfaction of
their own vanity they produce multitudes of books, and thereby steal time
from future generations, who are forced to study all these endless opinions.
<!-- Such contradictory opinions only increase entropy. -->
And descendants are forced to engage in activity with zero efficiency —
no work is performed to improve the world, while all energy is expended
on following outdated traditions.

How to achieve moderation?
Shlomo taught: “Whatever it is in your power to do, do with all your might”
(Kohelet [9:10](https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.9.10)).
This means that we must do everything to work
toward fulfilling G‑d's will in perfecting the world.
But when the ultra-Orthodox only study Torah instead of working
on applying it in practice, it is the same as if a person bought,
for example, some equipment and spent all his time only studying
the user manual, but never actually started using it.  The problem is
that the Orthodoxes forget that religion is not an end in itself, but
a means of drawing near to G‑d for building a worthy human civilization.
This is required for the development of the soul.

When the ultra-Orthodox do not work six days, then in order to distinguish
the Sabbath from other days, it is not sufficient for them simply to cease work,
as working Jews do.  The ultra-Orthodox must further impose upon themselves
a multitude of additional restrictions so that the Sabbath would be
distinguished from other days.  In brief, the scheme is as follows: the
non-Orthodox work on weekdays and do not work on the Sabbath.  But the
ultra-Orthodoxes do not work even on weekdays, i.e., they spend their time
as on the Sabbath; therefore, when the Sabbath arrives, they are compelled
additionally to further complicate their lives with such stringencies as
avoiding electricity, not carrying keys in their pockets, etc.

Only a portion of our time must be devoted to G‑d, while the rest is for work.
When we speak of “Shabbat kodesh” — “holy Shabbat”, it means that this day is
set apart for dedication to G‑d.  A portion of all that we receive from G‑d
must be returned.  For example, in Vayikra
[27:30,32](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.27.30-32) it is stated that every
tithe of the land and every tithe of cattle and sheep is consecrated to G‑d.
In modern terms, this corresponds to a tenth of our income, which is given
to charity for the sanctification of G‑d's Name — *kiddush HaShem*.

If we apply this same principle to the time granted us by G‑d, it means that
one-tenth of our time should be dedicated to G‑d.  Indeed, we can observe that
if the 24*7 hours of each week, i.e., 168 hours, are divided into 10 parts,
it turns out that the tithe of time is the 16–17 waking hours of the Sabbath.

<!-- This assumes that 7–8 hours are spent on sleep.
This time is sufficient to sleep well.
We need to sleep well in order to establish a connection with G‑d,
including to pray with kavanah, as stated in one blessing.
Then sleep is counted as service to G‑d
(KSA [71:4](https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Arukh.71.4)).
But when a person does not get enough sleep, he acts like a robot.
KSA [71:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Arukh.71.2)
states that six hours of sleep are sufficient.
Perhaps this is why among the Orthodoxes there are only erudites,
but no sages.  For example, Einstein slept no less than 10 hours. -->

> And the seventh day is the Sabbath unto the L‑rd, your G‑d
(Shemot [20:10](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.10),
[31:15](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.31.15),
Devarim [5:14](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.5.14)).

Therefore the Sabbath was made for G‑d, not for man.  At minimum, what is
required on the Sabbath — is not to work, i.e. it suffices simply to rest.
But to confirm that the Sabbath is dedicated to G‑d, it would be ideal
on the Sabbath to study Torah (Kitzur Shulchan Arukh
[77:24](https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Arukh.77.24)) —
in gratitude for G‑d having endowed us with freedom.  Six days we make use of
freedom, including freedom of choice in making decisions, and on the seventh day
we voluntarily renounce freedom of choice, so as to remember the tremendous
freedom G‑d has given us, and for this we dedicate one day to G‑d.

In general, two rationales were given for observing the Sabbath:
{: #shabbat title="Meaning of Shabbat"}

1. for G‑d rested on that day after the creation of the world
   (Shemot [20:11](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.11));
2. for G‑d freed from slavery and granted freedom
   (Devarim [5:15](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.5.15)).

By His own example, G‑d showed what must be done on Shabbat.  For six days G‑d
made decisions concerning the creation of the world, and on the seventh day He
ceased.  Therefore, for the duration of Shabbat we must relinquish the freedom
of decision-making with which G‑d has endowed us.

Let us examine this in more detail.

| For six days G‑d made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day.  Therefore G‑d blessed the seventh day and sanctified it. |
| (Shemot [20:11](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.11)) |
{: .chapter}

The previously mentioned examples demonstrate that in ancient times already
known was the law of refraining from activity involving freedom of choice and
decision-making on Shabbat.  This law was given to Moshe on Mount Sinai as part
of the oral traditions.  But later the sages forgot this law, and instead began
seeking a replacement for it, and through numerous convoluted explanations
attempted to devise justifications for prohibitions, and heaped up many
additions and stringencies — figuratively speaking, suspending mountains
by a hair, as was precisely noted in Mishnah Chagigah
[1](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Chagigah.1.8), in the sense that numerous
details of halakhot were accumulated upon brief passages of Torah.

And finally it came to the point where, in order to observe the Sabbath,
they must read through numerous thick books.  And not only read them, but also
memorize all the details down to the multitudinous conflicting opinions about
following every minor detail.

It would be a reductio ad absurdum for a complete understanding of the meaning
of the Sabbath prohibitions to require the reading and memorization in full of
such thick volumes as the Shulchan Arukh, when the Torah's idea was to give laws
in a scope accessible to all.

When I was studying a thick book about the Sabbath, there were difficulties in
retaining what I had read, since the definitions and rules governing the
applicability of the melakhot contained little logic, and much had to be
memorized.  The only thing that helped was that I had never encountered most of
the situations under consideration, for example: plowing a field, sowing seeds,
and other agricultural labors; sifting flour, baking bread, and other baking
activities; trapping a deer and shearing wool — all this was very far removed
from me.  Therefore I tried to commit to memory only those situations familiar
to me.  At that time I studied all this diligently and carefully.  And only
after the Orthodoxes rejected me did I begin to reread it critically, and each
time I was struck how could the Orthodoxes have come to this — that they so
tangled and complicated simple matters that before a person can simply move his
hand on Shabbat, he must read hundreds of pages — often containing contradictory
opinions.

Everything should be much simpler, because the Torah is accessible to everyone's
understanding.  There is nothing incomprehensible or inaccessible in the Torah.
Everything is simple and clear — it follows from the text of the Torah that all
Sabbath prohibitions reduce to one simple rule: G‑d programmed this world for
six days, and on the seventh He rested Himself and commanded us to do likewise.
Programming is a process of continuously making numerous decisions.  Therefore
on Shabbat any activity involving decision-making is forbidden.

Due to an incorrect understanding of the meaning of the Sabbath prohibitions,
on the one hand the Orthodoxes have added numerous superfluous prohibitions, while
on the other hand in certain cases the Orthodoxes permit themselves to violate
the Sabbath.

Of all the violations of the Sabbath permitted by Orthodox rabbis, the most
flagrant is the permission to play chess on Shabbat.  Many cases are known in
which Orthodox rabbis not only permitted Jews to do this, but themselves had the
custom of playing chess on Shabbat, setting only the restriction not to play for
money and not to record the moves.

It is hard to conceive of a more flagrant violation of the Sabbath.  For playing
chess, more than other forms of intellectual activity, demands enormous mental
effort and intensive work of the brain, and this fully contradicts both the
letter and the spirit of the Torah: G‑d blessed and sanctified the seventh day
because on that day G‑d rested from programming this world, i.e., from making
decisions about how to arrange this world in the best possible way.  And
thinking through chess combinations to choose the best move is an exact parallel
to that activity.  Both types of activity involve searching among possible
options and making a decision to select the most preferable among them.
There is even a well-known comparison of the entire world to a chessboard —
and in this sense it is a very fitting analogy, showing how similar these
conceptions are.

<!-- When all known options have been exhausted and the solution is still not
found, intuition comes into play.  Therefore computers only win against humans
when they have the ability to examine significantly more options, such that even
intuition does not help. -->

Why then do Orthodox rabbis permit this work on Shabbat?  The reasons are
material: only mundane aspects are considered.  First and foremost, attention
is given to physical actions, and it is permitted if the action does not fall
within the list of 39 melakhot and does not bring monetary gain.  Therefore
they permit violating the Sabbath with chess playing and other games, when the
manifestation of free choice during Sabbath rest introduces indeterminacy into
the world.

Thus the Orthodoxes are fixated solely on the purely materialistic aspect of the
world, on the mechanical interpretation of commandments, but they ignore the
sphere of the soul.  Yet the soul participates in decision-making and,
consequently, in changing the direction of the world's development.  That is,
they see only the “body” of the Torah, not the soul of the Torah.  Because of
such spiritual blindness, the Orthodoxes violate certain important commandments
of the Torah, and therefore they move further and further away from G‑d.

Chess is the most prominent example of games of the type
[game of skill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_skill),
when decisions during the game are made by the player.
The opposite of this are board games of the type
[game of chance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_chance),
when during the game decisions are made in Heaven.
Examples of such games: lottery, dice, roulette — when from Heaven influence
is exerted upon the human mind, to affect which lottery ball a person will draw,
to what height one will toss the die or coin, in which direction and at what
speed one will launch the ball over the roulette wheel, etc.  Many games are
a combination of these two types.

It is clear that since on the Sabbath one may not make any decisions,
any *games of skill* are forbidden on the Sabbath, but on other days
they are very much encouraged — for the development of skills.

But may one play *games of chance* on the Sabbath?
May one compel G‑d to make decisions on the Sabbath?
Strictly speaking, on any day one may not test G‑d without a valid reason,
as it is said in Devarim [6:16](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.16).
Therefore in childhood I only rarely performed such an experiment:
I would name the exact suit and rank of a card, and then from a thoroughly shuffled
deck draw a random card — and each time that card matched the one I had named.
But I strove not to repeat such experiments, so as not to test G‑d needlessly,
and so that such fortune through chutzpah would be better directed
toward more substantial needs.

Therefore, with *games of chance*, the situation is as follows.
When a game carries no obligation, when it is not
[gambling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling#Religious_views) for money
but, for example, playing with children — then it is ok.  But when a person's
future fate depends on the outcome of a game, G‑d is required to make a decision
about what to do with that person — to determine by their past deeds what should
befall them in the future.  For example, when a person in a casino stakes all
their money, and the result determines whether they become destitute or wealthy,
then demanding such a serious decision from G‑d is forbidden not only on the
Sabbath, but on any day of the week whatsoever.

All the above rules were recorded before studying the Mishnah Shabbat
[23](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Shabbat.23.2). <!-- and JT Shabbat
[23:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.23.2.1) -->
And there all this is confirmed: that a lottery with children is indeed ok,
e.g., when equal portions of food are being drawn, and nothing depends
on the outcome of the lot.

Playing musical instruments on Shabbat is forbidden by Orthodoxes with the
justification that performers might begin tuning musical instruments.  And here
the Orthodoxes are absolutely right — tuning instruments indeed requires making
decisions: using a [tuning fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuning_fork),
a sound of standard pitch is produced, and the tuner must adjust the
instrument's sound by ear, deciding based on this sound whether it is necessary
to decrease or increase the tension of the string, etc.  But after the
appearance of [electronic tuners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_tuner),
the musician no longer needs to decide whether the pitch matches — the program
does this for him.  Also, not all instruments require tuning — many instruments
have no parts that can go out of tune at all.  Therefore, the argument for
prohibition of performance due to possible tuning loses its force.

The actual performance of memorized melodies requires absolutely no
decision-making.  I have experience playing musical instruments, so from
personal experience I can confirm with complete certainty that there is
no problem in this — the reproduction of sounds is done without thinking,
all movements are performed mechanically, unconsciously, and thus
the brain rests and does not work.

History confirms that the Jewish people have long been aware of this principle.
Josephus reports that according to tradition going back to King David,
the Levites sang in the Temple both on Sabbath days and on festivals, and
accompanied themselves on musical instruments: they played stringed and plucked
instruments, sounded wind instruments, struck cymbals, etc.
(Divrei ha‑yamim I [15:16](https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.15.16),
Divrei ha‑yamim II [5:12-13](https://www.sefaria.org/II_Chronicles.5.12-13))
<!-- In the modern world, among stringed instruments the guitar
has become the most popular. -->

Yet now all this is forbidden by the Orthodoxes in synagogues, i.e., they have
destroyed the magnificent tradition established by King David himself.  They
have also prohibited sounding the shofar during Shabbat, even on Rosh HaShanah,
despite the fact that Moshe himself decreed the blowing of silver trumpets on
Shabbat to summon the people to assembly, which was done until the destruction
of the Second Temple, and there is a commandment to sound the shofar on Rosh
HaShanah, and this violates not one of the 39 melakhot.  Yet another fence
around the Torah — so barricaded themselves that even light can no longer
get through.

Let us now examine various cases and compare them with how the Orthodoxes
understand them.  We shall not consider absolutely every possible case, as the
Orthodoxes attempt to do, writing them out over thousands of pages, so that it
is unrealistic for a normal busy person to read and follow everything written.

For example, when dragging a chair across the ground is forbidden due to the
prohibition against plowing — this is a completely absurd association.  But what
if we consider the context of this action?  Imagine that a person dines daily on
a summer terrace with an earthen floor and before eating slides his chair to the
table along the ground.  Can this be done on Shabbat as well?  Certainly, it can,
since the person does it automatically, without thinking.  However, if the
chairs needed to be moved in order to arrange them and seat guests, that becomes
problematic.  But the ground is no longer relevant here — it is problematic to
do even indoors.  Therefore beforehand, before Shabbat, one must arrange the
chairs in the room before the table, so that on Shabbat one need not consider
where the guests will sit, as Orthodoxes permit themselves to do.  Orthodoxes
consider it permissible to violate Shabbat by moving furniture in the house,
whereas arranging furniture is an activity involving decision-making.
Therefore, on Shabbat it's permissible to perform only habitual,
long-practiced actions.

And in general, large objects cannot be carried either in the street or in
a private domain, since to grasp them more conveniently one must think and make
decisions — and an eruv changes nothing.  In pockets, on the contrary, one may
carry everything needed: both keys and handkerchiefs — both in a private domain
and in the street — there is likewise no difference due to the eruv.

Another example: the Orthodoxes permit both cracking nuts and peeling seeds on
the Sabbath, seeing no difference between these actions.  Yet cracking nuts is
precisely the same type of activity as gathering firewood: one must decide how
best to grip it so as not to strike one's fingers with the hammer, etc.
Therefore it is *muktze*.
Peeling seeds, by contrast, consists of mechanical actions requiring no
decision-making, which can be performed without looking — for example,
while reading.  It is permitted to perform habitual automatic actions
like robots, according to pre-programmed algorithms.
Likewise there is no problem if one has previously opened a package of some
product — e.g., a jar or bottle — and already knows how to do it automatically.
But if one must devise a new unusual method and perform some action in a special
manner instead of the habitual one, that constitutes a violation of the Sabbath.

But the worst violation of the Sabbath occurs during the transgression of their
own arbitrarily established self-imposed restrictions.  Then the Orthodoxes
frantically attempt to find a way out of the situation that has arisen,
but as a result a real violation of the Sabbath occurs, when they are compelled
to make decisions about what actions must be taken to rectify violations of
their own stringencies.

Therefore, just as a wise person learns not from their own mistakes but from
the mistakes of others, non-Orthodox Jews have the opportunity not to repeat
the errors of the Orthodoxes, but rather, knowing the main principle of Sabbath
observance, to practice it precisely as follows from the contemporary
understanding of the Torah, adding nothing and subtracting nothing — even better
and more accurately than the Orthodoxes, following the spirit of the Torah.

All the lengthy descriptions of Sabbath prohibition details with often
strained and unfounded explanations can be replaced with one general principle,
the meaning of which can be expressed in one phrase —
**ON SHABBAT, ANY ACTIVITY INVOLVING DECISION-MAKING IS FORBIDDEN**.
All 39 melakhot are covered by this Torah principle, and on its basis it's
possible to answer any question concerning the prohibition of any action on
Shabbat.  And even such a vague concept with unclear definitional criteria as
the prohibition on creative and generative activity on the Sabbath, which
the Orthodoxes attempted to introduce as a supplement to the insufficient
39 melakhot — this too is covered by this same principle.

On one hand, although the Orthodoxes do not grasp the essence of Shabbat and
its restrictions, they have created such an enormous quantity of additional
stringencies “just in case” that in many types of activity Shabbat is
nonetheless not violated.  But on the other hand, as punishment for adding
unnecessary restrictions, they pay with hardship from the tremendous
inconveniences they have created for themselves.  On the Sabbath, the Orthodoxes
must strain greatly, expending too much strength and nerves to fulfill their
multitude of needless restrictions and stringencies — instead of resting.
For example, in multistory buildings they are forced to expend a lot of effort
while climbing stairs — instead of using an effortless elevator, etc.

And the most terrible thing is that many Jews could not bear the burden of
artificial stringencies and the enormous number of details for their observance
with which the rabbis burdened them, and completely abandoned the observance of
the Sabbath.  And all this because of the violation of the prohibition against
adding new laws.

For example, on one hand, the Orthodoxes are absolutely right when they assert
that driving cars is forbidden on the Sabbath.  But on the other hand, driving
is forbidden for a completely different reason, not the one the Orthodoxes cite.
It makes no sense to offer such an inappropriate explanation that pressing
a button to start the engine is like kindling fire, etc.  Citing this explanation
is precisely the same misunderstanding as the prohibition against
using electricity on Shabbat.

One of the greatest harms inflicted upon Judaism by the Orthodoxes is the
recently introduced prohibition on using electrical devices on Shabbat.
G‑d gave the opportunity to use electricity so that all Jews — even those who
have departed from religion — would better observe Shabbat.  But the Orthodoxes
completely perverted G‑d's design, rejected G‑d's gift (as the scouts
faint-heartedly rejected G‑d's gift of the land of Canaan), and added a new
commandment forbidding the use of electricity on Shabbat.  Because of this
unfounded and senseless stringency, many Jews have abandoned Sabbath observance
altogether.
{: #electricity title="Electricity"}

Until the 19th century, the primary source of heat in households was fire,
mainly in various types of stoves, for which the fuel was wood and kindling.
Then gas stoves began to appear, with heating also accomplished by means of
an open flame.  The Torah's prohibition on kindling fire on the Sabbath is
quite unambiguous, so there are no questions here.

Gradually, heating over an open flame began to be replaced with electric stoves.
The operating principle of an electric stove consists in the release of thermal
energy when electric current passes through a heating element in the burner.
Induction cooktops went even further — they heat iron cookware placed upon them
by means of eddy currents created by a magnetic field.  Microwave ovens have
a somewhat different operating principle — microwave ovens heat food by means of
high-frequency electromagnetic radiation.  The main thing all these electrical
appliances have in common is that fire plays no part whatsoever in their
operation.

Therefore, there is no problem with using such electric kitchen appliances to
warm up food.  But cooking on the Sabbath is certainly forbidden, because
[food preparation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_food_preparation)
involves making decisions — how much of each ingredient to add, in what order
according to the recipe, then periodically tasting to check how ready it is
(similar to tuning musical instruments), etc.  On the other hand, reheating food
prepared on a weekday in either a microwave or on an electric stove presents
no problem, since no law of the Torah is thereby violated, just as the manna
gathered on weekdays in the wilderness could be consumed on the Sabbath.

By analogy, one could theoretically also turn on an electric washing machine,
but one may not decide which laundry to put in it, how much detergent to add,
or which wash program to set.

There is likewise no justification for the prohibition against using hot water
from a boiler on Shabbat, whose operating principle is analogous to that of
an electric stove.  Moreover, washing with cold water diminishes *oneg Shabbat* —
the delight of the Sabbath.
<!-- And the Orthodox prohibition on flushing the toilet altogether defiles the Sabbath. -->
Orthodoxes forbid using an electric boiler because it heats water above
45°C (113°F), which for them is equivalent to cooking.  Interestingly,
before I learned about the 45°C (113°F), I selected the most comfortable
water temperature and set the boiler to 40°C (104°F) — this is the optimal
temperature when hot water from the tap is not diluted with cold.
At the same time, energy is not wasted unnecessarily.
<!-- It's important not to forget to periodically perform the anti-legionella
procedure at 60°C (140°F), but not on the Sabbath.  -->

And when the Orthodoxes accidentally turn on the hot water, they leave the water
running until the end of the Sabbath.  And when they open a refrigerator in
which they forgot to unscrew the light bulb before the Sabbath, they leave it
open all day.
<!-- Although according to Rambam (Mishneh Torah Hilkhot Shabbat
[1:19](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Sabbath.1.19)),
one may close a refrigerator door that was opened by mistake.
Or, for example, after punishment in the form of a punctured tire
for driving on the Sabbath, since the Sabbath has already been violated,
G‑d permits repairing the car and transporting it home that same Sabbath,
sparing one from having to pay a fine for overnight parking.
Or when one erred regarding programming on the Sabbath, one may complete it.
But one must not be brazen, and must endeavor to ensure such things do not recur. -->
Continuously moving elevators also waste energy needlessly.  But worst of all is
when lights are left burning in all rooms day and night throughout all Sabbaths
and festivals.
<!-- This was especially noticeable in the ultra-Orthodox quarter of London,
where brightly lit windows of houses shone everywhere throughout the nights. -->
All this needlessly wastes natural resources.  Though it is a small drop in
the scale of the entire planet, the principle itself matters here — whether
a person follows the commandment to care for the Earth even in small things.
Wastefulness, the pointless squandering of resources gifted by G‑d — this is not
the Jewish way.  In accordance with the ecological commandment of Devarim
[20:19](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.20.19), this principle bears the
name *Baal Tashchit*.  The sages in many places in the Talmud teach not to
resemble idolaters who waste material resources needlessly.  Rambam included
the prohibition against wastefulness in the list of 613 commandments
([M−57](https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot,_Negative_Commandments.57)).
And Sefer HaChinukh [529](https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.529.2)
instructs not to waste even a grain of mustard.

Whence then came the prohibition against turning electrical lighting
on and off on the Sabbath?

Until the 19th century, candles were primarily used for illuminating spaces.
After the invention of the electric light bulb, some rabbis apparently thought
that the incandescent filament resembled a candle in a glass bulb, although in
reality there is no flame there — when electric current flows through the metal
filament, electromagnetic thermal waves are emitted.  Recent innovations
contain no filaments at all: in fluorescent lamps, ultraviolet radiation
from an electric discharge in mercury vapor is converted into light by means of
a phosphor, while LED (light-emitting diode) lamps emit photons when electrons
recombine as current passes through a semiconductor
[n–p junction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P–n_junction).

Richard Feynman in his memoirs writes about a discussion with Orthodoxes.
They asked him whether electricity is fire.  To which Feynman answered that
electricity is not fire.  It is not a chemical process — unlike fire.  And even
electrical sparks that may appear when pressing an elevator button are also not
fire at all.  And if they were so concerned about sparks, he proposed placing
a capacitor in parallel with the switch — and there would be no sparks.
But they silently ignored this proposal.

Thus, due to ignorance and lack of knowledge in the field of physics among
*poskim*, some Jews are forced to turn the Sabbath into an extremely difficult
quest with enormous inconveniences, while others have completely abandoned
Sabbath observance altogether.
<!-- The ultra-Orthodox do not know the laws of physics, did not study them
in school — and suffer because of this.  But the non-Orthodox know the laws
of physics, therefore they can use electricity on the Sabbath. -->

But progress cannot be stopped.  More and more, electronics enter our lives,
and it becomes impossible to refrain from using electricity even for one day.
For example, on the way to synagogue it becomes impossible to walk down the
street without entering the field of view of surveillance cameras,
<!-- only the webcam [Aish](https://aish.com/w) on Sabbaths
is redirected to [Ezrat Israel](https://ezratisrael.com) -->
without triggering motion sensors that activate lighting or automatic door
opening, without passing through a metal detector frame; it becomes impossible
to enter a building or room without an electronic key or biometric
identification, etc.

And further, the integration of electronics will continue to accelerate.
Voice control of computerized devices is increasingly coming into use.
Hearing aids have been in use for a long time.  Myoelectric prosthetics have
become a reality, in which sensors read the electrical potential of muscles and
transmit it to a microprocessor, which converts the signal into corresponding
movement of the prosthetic's motors.  Other bionic prosthetics receive signals
directly from the brain.  In the future, there will be an increasingly close
integration of humans with electronics.

The most absurd prohibition one could possibly devise is the ban on using
low-voltage microelectronics on account of kindling fire.  Even the explanation
based on the prohibition of building (*boneh*), as well as the prohibition of
creating a new object (*molid*), during closing a circuit makes no sense in
semiconductor devices.  By the same reasoning, one should also prohibit using
plumbing: in one case a faucet is opened and water flows, while in the other —
the gate of a field-effect transistor is opened and electric current flows.
<!-- The flow of water molecules through pipes resembles the flow of electrons
through wires, though they operate on different principles. -->

And it seems utterly absurd to prohibit the use of a computer on the grounds
that computer terminology has adopted the word *write*, and then to cite
the prohibition of *writing* as one of the 39 melakhot.  But the operating
principle of computer memory and writing on paper are completely different.
Therefore, when using other possible terms, e.g., *save*, *store*, the problem
resolves itself, and there is no longer any use of “writing”, but only of
*storing* information on a medium in the form of various voltage levels
corresponding to discrete values of 0 and 1 in memory, or in the form of
a magnetization vector on disks.  Just as nobody can prohibit storing
information received on the Sabbath in the brain, so too the memory cells of
a computer for practical purposes are nothing other than an extension of the
human brain.

Therefore, neither the use of a computer nor a smartphone is forbidden by the
laws of the Torah.  But just as one and the same instrument can be used both to
heal and to harm, one instrument can be used both to fulfill commandments and to
violate them.  So too with a computer: anyone can both better observe Shabbat and
violate it.  Everything depends on the specific actions: on one hand, it is
commendable to study Torah on a computer on Shabbat, while on the other hand,
composing texts, programs, and other creative works violates the Sabbath.

But it should be noted that the Orthodox rabbis acted correctly when they
completely prohibited the use of computers and smartphones on the Sabbath — it
was necessary to err on the side of caution, since it was unclear which specific
actions on a computer violate the Sabbath.  They prohibited it for the same
reason they prohibit playing musical instruments: due to the fear that a person
might wish to engage in tuning the instrument, which indeed constitutes
a violation of the Sabbath.
Therefore, immediately upon the invention of the computer, they erected
a fence around it — “pending clarification of the circumstances”.  And this is
understandable: a new phenomenon appeared, and despite the many-volumed
discussions of the Talmud and numerous commentaries, it is completely unclear
what obligations the use of the new device imposes.

And only humanity's recent achievements in understanding the surrounding world
have made it possible to comprehend which actions with these devices are
permissible from the Torah's perspective, corresponding to the spirit of the
Torah.  Only now, when the general principle of Sabbath prohibitions has been
clarified, can it be applied to evaluate specific actions.

As has already been noted, G‑d forbids programming on the Sabbath.  Programming
consists in the continuous making of decisions.  Therefore, it is quite simple
to apply this criterion to various actions performed on a computer or
smartphone, and depending on this, we can easily understand what violates
the Sabbath and what does not.

Undoubtedly, the process of reading does not require making decisions.  No rabbi
can forbid reading the Torah on Shabbat, especially when a person works much all
the rest of the time, so that free time for studying Torah remains only on
Shabbat.  At present, the transition from paper information carriers
(which are now often called by the term
*[dead-tree](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dead_tree)*) to digital equivalents
of printed books is being completed.  Paper books are completely going out of
use.  For example, I have not bought paper books for 20 years now — there is
simply no longer any need for this, everything is available in electronic form.
And it is not so much about preserving trees, <!-- and in the case of parchment
from animal skin also preserving the lives of animals, as well as the rejection
of sacrifices --> but rather about convenience — there is no need to constantly
carry suitcases with a weighty library.  Even carrying a heavy siddur on trips
and to the place of prayer is very burdensome, while a mobile phone is always
at hand.  This is what progress exists for — it is part of the process of
perfecting the world.  Therefore, it is praiseworthy to study Torah
from a computer screen, and also read prayers from a smartphone screen.

<!-- When the eyes grew unaccustomed to printed type, they would begin to hurt
when reading books.  Therefore, there remained no other option but to read
prayers from a mobile phone. -->

<!-- Who is engaged in a more G‑dly pursuit: Orthodoxes who spend the Sabbath reading
secular literature from paper, or non-Orthodoxes who study Torah from a computer
screen on Shabbat?  The answer is obvious. -->

Reading news on the Internet, on social media, differs in no way from the verbal
exchange of weekly news during conversations at Sabbath meals.  Moreover, in
emergency situations it is often necessary to stay informed of vitally important
news.  Reading news for entertainment also accords with the spirit of the Sabbath.

Likewise, voice communication by telephone is analogous to direct communication,
as is video communication via [Zoom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software))
or [Jitsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitsi).  It would seem that communication
on social networks should also be unproblematic.  But there are nuances.

Giving likes presents no problem when one immediately knows whether one likes a post
or comment, and no reaction needs to be chosen.  But one cannot post non-trivial
posts when the process of writing a new post requires selecting the right words
and composing complex sentences.  This resembles composing a new book.
Likewise, formatting a post often requires making decisions.  For the same
reason, even for synagogue addresses permitted by the Orthodoxes, one must
prepare one's speech in advance rather than allow improvisation on the Sabbath.
<!-- One may share, since it is the same post that need not be composed anew. -->

Whether one may reply to a post and leave comments depends on whether the words
of the response immediately come to mind, as in face-to-face conversation.  One
may not deliberate at length over a response to a post or comment, but one may
send comments when the text of the reply appears in one's mind at once.  There
is no difference whether the text of the reply is typed on a keyboard or swiped
on a touchscreen, because this is analogous to voice input using a dictaphone.
But one may not edit photographs, and indeed one may not photograph at all when
choosing an angle or camera settings is required.

A deterministic universe resembles a film, where souls do not participate in
altering a predetermined sequence of states.  Consequently, watching preselected
films also does not violate the Sabbath — when watching films, as with listening
to music or audiobooks, no choice is made among several options, just as no
problem of choice arises when reading a book.  Therefore, besides reading,
an ideal activity for full rest, to take one's mind off daily routine,
is to watch a good film or series in the evening.

May one visit shops?  Yes, if one walks through shops as through an exhibition.
But purchasing decisions must be postponed until the end of the Sabbath.

The problem of Sabbath transportation is also easily solved.
If the synagogue is not within walking distance,
there are several ways to get from home to the synagogue
using transportation:

- Public transportation.  There is no violation in using public transportation —
  one may freely board a bus, trolleybus, tram, or subway, and sit in
  a passenger seat, or stand holding the handrails.  Upon entry, a contactless
  card is validated, such as *[Rav-Kav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rav-Kav)*.

As has already been said, including by the example of the tree of knowledge
in Gan Eden, stringencies lead to the violation of commandments.  Because the
Orthodoxes violate the prohibition against adding and also mix commandments with
stringencies — because of this, the difference is not visible between the
commandment forbidding driving a vehicle and the stringency of rabbis forbidding
riding as a passenger.  As a result, when one needs to reach the synagogue on
the Sabbath, from these two prohibitions they choose the one whose violation
is more convenient and comfortable, and therefore get behind the wheel of
a vehicle, violating the Sabbath.  But only riding as a passenger on all types
of transport does not violate the Sabbath.  <!-- The only minor drawback in
diaspora countries — the non-Jewish bustle accompanying the journey may weaken
the sense of the Sabbath spirit. -->

- A taxi with a non-Jewish driver is the most acceptable solution to the problem,
  especially for residential areas
  with insufficient public transportation coverage.
  In any case, one may ride as a passenger in a car,
  or in any vehicle whatsoever.

- In the near future, the problem will be solved by the widespread adoption of
  [self-driving cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car)
  and autonomous public transportation — trains with automatic control
  have already been implemented in many countries around the world.

Even the use of autonomous vehicles with only partial automation would suffice,
because in dangerous situations one could take control manually for
*pikuach nefesh* — in cases where human life is threatened, the Torah suspends
all Sabbath restrictions.  <!-- Although in many cases a computer responds more
quickly in resolving a dangerous situation — a computer has faster reaction time. -->

One of the problems hindering the widespread adoption of driverless vehicles is
that they are forced to drive simultaneously in the same traffic flow with the
majority of existing vehicles driven by unpredictable drivers.  If there were
only vehicles on the road operating by known algorithms and exchanging data
among themselves, it would be much simpler.  Israel has a unique situation
in that on Shabbat, only driverless transport could be permitted to operate.
Such an experiment would help facilitate the transition to automated control
throughout the world.

To understand which actions do not violate the Sabbath, various heuristics may
be applied.  For example, a good heuristic is that one may perform actions
during which a person is completely absorbed in some thought — for instance,
contemplating the content of the weekly Torah portion.  In such cases, one may
perform all actions during which the person is focused on other thoughts
unrelated to the actions being performed.  This ensures that decisions for
carrying out these actions will not be made.  When the mind is occupied with
listening to auditory information or contemplating some thought, it is highly
unlikely that actions requiring decision-making can be performed at the same time.

All this presupposes a higher level of consciousness and responsibility, when
a person honestly acknowledges the degree to which a given action corresponds to
this criterion.  Because no rabbi can get inside one's head and monitor whether
a person is mentally violating the Sabbath — for example, making plans in his
thoughts for the coming week or mentally solving everyday problems.  Therefore,
all of the above is inapplicable to a situation where all physical actions of
the congregation are controlled, when the Sabbath is observed under coercion,
out of fear of condemnation, punishment, excommunication from the community,
etc.  Since rabbis have no means of verifying whether a person makes decisions
on the Sabbath, observance must rest upon the personal responsibility of each
individual.  G‑d-pleasing observance must be sustained by conscience alone.
<!-- that it may go well with oneself and one's loved ones -->  In this is the
meaning of the entire Torah — the transition from coerced adherence to the Torah
to voluntary adherence.

For example, the Orthodoxes do not forbid programming on Shabbat,
i.e., thinking through program design, etc., yet this violates the Sabbath.
Therefore, the only solution is individual responsibility for one's actions.
Just as in a democracy a person takes responsibility for their actions,
so too here one must fear only G‑d alone, and not the rabbis.

Modern technologies were given by G‑d for better observance,
so that even those who do not observe would not violate the commandments.
And those who do observe would do so with greater comfort,
restoring the possibility to rest on the day of rest.

In earlier times, observance was burdened by many hardships, which caused many
to give up and abandon observance altogether.  Therefore G‑d provided the
possibility to observe Shabbat without toil, without excessive strain.  All
electrical appliances fulfill the role of a Shabbos goy (and in the future will
extend to Shabbos androids with voice interface).  Both electric lighting and
the ability to warm food on an electric stove and in a microwave, and water in
an electric kettle — all these possibilities were provided so that fire would
not be kindled on the Sabbath.  In many buildings, candles with open flame are
forbidden to be left burning unattended in observance of fire safety regulations
— so as not to play with fire on the Sabbath.  For such cases, for example, the
Zomet Institute sells electric Sabbath candles with an incandescent bulb powered
by batteries.  Also, for more thorough searching for chametz, it is better to
use a flashlight.
<!-- Also smoking is not recommended, but if someone cannot break this habit,
then on the Sabbath one can smoke electronic cigarettes.  -->
Replacing candles with electricity makes sense, since the main thing is
not fire but light.
<!-- For example, Hanukkah is a festival of light, not of fire, as among pagans. -->
On the first day of Creation G‑d created photons of light, therefore
it's possible to use them on Shabbat as well.

It is interesting to compare how various denominations of Judaism interpret
Sabbath prohibitions.  The Karaites forbade using candlelight on the Sabbath,
and therefore sat in darkness for a full day.  The Orthodoxes, unlike the
Karaites, act more reasonably and permit the use of both candlelight and
electric light.  But because they forbid switching on lights, they are compelled
to endure constantly illuminated lighting, or when they failed to turn on
the light beforehand, they too sit in darkness like the Karaites.  That is, due
to the prohibition against touching switches, they are forced either to waste
electricity needlessly or to sit in darkness like the Karaites.

According to the schema “thesis → antithesis ⇒ synthesis”: the Karaite thesis is
that fire should not be used at all.  In opposition to the Karaites, the
Orthodox antithesis is that fire may be used if kindled beforehand.  And the
non-Orthodox synthesis of these opposites is as follows: fire is replaced with
electricity, thus satisfying both thesis and antithesis — fire is neither used
nor kindled.  Therefore, non-Orthodoxes, as the cleverest ones, can freely use
electricity, observing even better than Karaites and Orthodoxes, while not
violating the plain meaning of the 39 melakhot.

<!-- To distinguish themselves from the Karaites, who fear using candles on the
Sabbath, the Orthodoxes adopted the custom of lighting candles for the Sabbath.
In exactly the same way, to distinguish oneself from the Orthodoxes, who fear
turning on electricity on the Sabbath, one can turn on electric lighting.
Thus, Shabbat is observed better than among the Orthodoxes — on the Sabbath
fire is not used at all, whatsoever.  At the same time, such inconveniences as
the Karaites experience are not created.  There is no problem in lighting fire
before the onset of the Sabbath, and on the Sabbath continuing to use it, since
none of this is connected with making decisions.  But if someone doubts whether
there is a grain of truth in the traditions of the Karaites, who do not use fire
at all on the Sabbath, then one can turn on electric candles.  -->

Another example: Shemot [16:29](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.16.29)
commands one to remain in place and not go out from one's location.
Although this was said concerning the gatherers of manna who went out into the
field on the Sabbath, the Karaites interpreted this commandment literally and
did not leave their dwellings at all, or went out only to the kenesa.
The Orthodoxes, however, derived a law that forbids going beyond
the boundaries of a settlement for a distance exceeding 2000 cubits (about
a kilometer), i.e., they invented an arbitrary restriction.  By combining these
restrictions, non-Orthodox Jews have the ability to travel even outside the city
for any distance, but the main thing is — not behind the wheel, but, for
example, on public transport or in self-driving electric vehicles.  Because
following the principle of relativity, if one sits in a passenger seat,
then such a frame of reference remains stationary relative to the body of the
vehicle, and no movement occurs.  Therefore, the person does not leave their
place, but the place moves together with the person.

<!-- The Karaites also abstain from marital relations on the Sabbath, claiming
that this is work (*melakhah*).  But in this case, a person need not make any
decisions — a new human being is not designed from scratch, but simply begins
to execute a pre-programmed genetic code. -->

In all these examples, we see how, unlike the Karaites who observe only the
letter of the law, the non-Orthodox must follow the spirit of the Torah,
adapting all achievements of civilization for better observance.  But the
Orthodoxes do neither: they follow neither the letter nor the spirit,
but invent their own new laws.

If we briefly summarize:

- Karaites: literal understanding of the Torah, with their own traditions;
- Orthodoxes: numerous added oral laws that have become an additional (oral) Torah;
- non-Orthodoxes: interpretation of the Torah in accordance with contemporary
  needs, and preservation of rabbinic traditions, observance of which is
  optional but desirable for continuity and respect for ancestral heritage,
  i.e. following traditions accepted by all the Jewish people, e.g., such as
  the celebration of Purim and Hanukkah, which are not in the Written Torah,
  but are an important part of Judaism.

By literal understanding, the Karaites mean their following only the peshat when
it describes in detail the particulars of fulfilling a commandment.  When the
peshat allows for multiple interpretations, they choose the strictest one, as,
for example, in the case of the prohibition against using fire kindled
beforehand.  And when the peshat does not contain detailed particulars,
it is then understood metaphorically, in order to avoid inventing new oral laws,
such as the innovations of the Rabbanites.

Honestly, in worldview I am much closer to the Orthodoxes than to the Karaites,
because the formalistic interpretation of Torah laws by the Karaites accords
poorly with the constantly changing demands of the times.  Despite their
rejection of oral laws, the Karaites have their own primitive oral
interpretation, and it does not evolve.  In all the polemics with Karaites
known to me, I have sided with the Orthodoxes.  My worldview <!-- *hashkafah* -->
coincides in many ways with the Orthodox one.  But the problem with the
Orthodoxes is that, just as with the Karaites, among the Orthodoxes too the oral
laws have ceased developing, and all the accumulated errors can no longer be
corrected.

Like the Sadducees, the Karaites rejected oral traditions and insisted on
literal adherence to the Written Torah, and in this they repeated the error of
the Sadducees, which led to their disappearance.  In our time, the same error is
repeated by the Orthodoxes, who deny the necessity of developing oral traditions
to meet the new demands of the modern world.
